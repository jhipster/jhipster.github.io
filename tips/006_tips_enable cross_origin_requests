# Access to the API from 3rd party sites

You might want to use the nice out-of-the-box API to integrate your app into existing websites. 
One approach could be to use [Knockout](https://github.com/knockout/knockout) to bind your entities with ease and render the entity on e.g. your blog, being served from your jhipster app. 
two aspects need to be changed in standard jhipster in order to use the API from simple HTML/AJAX clients:

1. configure the `SecurityConfiguration`
1. tell the browsers of the users that visit the 3rd party site that uses the API that your app permits the origin of that request.

## SecurityConfiguration
In method `SecurityConfiguration.configure(HttpSecurity http)` , add new directives as needed in the `.and().authorizeRequests()` part, e.g. `.antMatchers("/api/_search/meetings/**").permitAll()            .antMatchers("/api/_search/meetings").permitAll()`   

Of course you can make use of `.hasAuthority()` and `.authenticated()` to make your thinst-client a bit more dynamic. 



## Adapt response headers 


Therefore you need to add the following directives to `CsrfCookieGeneratorFilter` :
In method `doFilterInternal(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain filterChain) throws ServletException, IOException`

`response.addHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");`
`response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods", "POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE");`
`response.setHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "86400"); // 24 Hours`
`response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept, x-auth-token");`
