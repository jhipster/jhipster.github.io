# How to upgrade after the first time

__Tip submitted by [@tibistibi](https://github.com/tibistibi)__

You want to keep on track with upgrades from jhipster but also want your changes to be taken into account.

The first time you upgrade jhipster the upgrade process will create an upgrade branch, which is really great.
But the second time you upgrade this branch will be reused and will be old. Changes you made will not be taken into account. 
There are 2 files which should be upgraded before the process starts. This can be done with the following git commands:

	git checkout jhipster_upgrade
	git checkout --patch master .yo-rc.json
	git checkout --patch master .jhipster
	git commit -a
	git push --set-upstream origin jhipster_upgrade
	git checkout master
  
(or you just delete the jhipster_upgrade branch).
