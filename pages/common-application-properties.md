# <i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Common application properties

JHipster generates a Spring Boot application, and can be configured using the standard Spring Boot properties mechanism.

Those properties are configured at generation-time by JHipster, and often have different values in development and production modes: learn more about this in our [Profiles documentation]({{ site.url }}/profiles/).

In a JHipster application, there are three kinds of properties:

1. [Spring Boot standard application properties](#1)
2. [JHipster application properties](#2)
3. [Application-specific properties](#3)

## <a name="1"></a> Spring Boot standard application properties

Like any Spring Boot application, JHipster allows you to configure any standard [Spring Boot application property](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html).

## <a name="2"></a> JHipster application properties

JHipster provides specific application properties, which come from the [JHipster server-side library](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster). Those properties are standard for all JHipster projects, but some of them only work depending on what you selected when you built your application: for example the `jhipster.cache.hazelcast` key only works if you selected Hazelcast as your 2nd-level Hibernate cache.

Those properties are configured using the `io.github.jhipster.config.JHipsterProperties` class.

Here is a documentation for those properties:

    jhipster:

        # Thread pool that will be used for asynchronous method calls in JHipster
        async:
            core-pool-size: 2 # Initial pool size
            max-pool-size: 50 # Maximum pool size
            queue-capacity: 10000 # Queue capacity of the pool

        # Specific configuration for JHipster gateways
        # See https://www.jhipster.tech/api-gateway/ for more information on JHipster gateways
        gateway:
            rate-limiting:
                enabled: false # Rate limiting is disabled by default
                limit: 100_000L # By default we allow 100,000 API calls
                duration-in-seconds: 3_600 # By default the rate limiting is reinitialized every hour
            authorized-microservices-endpoints: # Access Control Policy, if left empty for a route, all endpoints will be accessible
                app1: /api # recommended prod configuration, it allows the access to all API calls from the "app1" microservice

        # HTTP configuration
        http:
            # V_1_1 for HTTP/1.1 or V_2_0 for HTTP/2.
            # To use HTTP/2 you will need SSL support (see the Spring Boot "server.ssl" configuration)
            version: V_1_1
            #Force the server cipher suite to follow the exact order specifying in server.ssl.ciphers (For perfect forward secrecy)

## <a name="3"></a> Application-specific properties

Your generated application can also have its own Spring Boot properties. This is highly recommended, as it allows type-safe configuration of the application, as well as auto-completion and documentation within an IDE.

JHipster has generated a `ApplicationProperties` class in the `config` package, which is already preconfigured, and it is already documented at the bottom the `application.yml`, `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml` files. All you need to do is code your own specific properties.
