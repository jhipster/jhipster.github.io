# <i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Common application properties

JHipster generates a Spring Boot application, and can be configured using the standard Spring Boot properties mechanism.

Those properties are configured at generation-time by JHipster, and often have different values in development and production modes: learn more about this in our [Profiles documentation]({{ site.url }}/profiles/).

In a JHipster application, there are three kinds of properties:

1. [Spring Boot standard application properties](#1)
2. [JHipster application properties](#2)
3. [Application-specific properties](#3)

## <a name="1"></a> Spring Boot standard application properties

Like any Spring Boot application, JHipster allows you to configure any standard [Spring Boot application property](http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/common-application-properties.html).

## <a name="2"></a> JHipster application properties

JHipster provides specific application properties, which come from the [JHipster server-side library](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster). Those properties are standard for all JHipster projects, but some of them only work depending on what you selected when you built your application: for example the `jhipster.cache.hazelcast` key only works if you selected Hazelcast as your 2nd-level Hibernate cache.

Those properties are configured using the `io.github.jhipster.config.JHipsterProperties` class.

Here is a documentation for those properties:

    jhipster:

        # Thread pool that will be used for asynchronous method calls in JHipster
        async:
            core-pool-size: 2 # Initial pool size
            max-pool-size: 50 # Maximum pool size
            queue-capacity: 10000 # Queue capacity of the pool

        # HTTP configuration
        http:
            cache: # Used by io.github.jhipster.web.filter.CachingHttpHeadersFilter
                timeToLiveInDays: 1461 # Static assets are cached for 4 years by default

        # Hibernate 2nd level cache, used by CacheConfiguration
        cache:
            hazelcast: # Hazelcast configuration
                time-to-live-seconds: 3600 # By default objects stay 1 hour in the cache
                backup-count: 1 # Number of objects backups

        # E-mail properties
        mail:
            from: jhipster@localhost # The default "from" address for e-mails
            base-url: http://127.0.0.1:8080 # URL to the application, used inside e-mails

        # Spring Security specific configuration
        security:
            remember-me: # JHipster secure implementation of the remember-me mechanism, for session-based authentication
                # security key (this key should be unique for your application, and kept secret)
                key: 0b32a651e6a65d5731e869dc136fb301b0a8c0e4
            client-authorization: # Used with JHipster UAA authentication
                access-token-uri: # URL of the JHipster UAA server OAuth tokens
                token-service-id: # ID of the current application
                client-id: # OAuth client ID
                client-secret: # OAuth client secret
            authentication:
                jwt: # JHipster specific JWT implementation
                    secret: # JWT secret key
                    token-validity-in-seconds: 86400 # Token is valid 24 hours
                    token-validity-in-seconds-for-remember-me: 2592000 # Remember me token is valid 30 days
                oauth: # Used by the JHipster OAuth 2 MongoDB specific implementation
                    client-id: # OAuth client ID
                    client-secret: # OAuth client secret
                    token-validity-in-seconds: 1800 # Token is valid 30 minutes

## <a name="3"></a> Application-specific properties

Your generated application can also have its own Spring Boot properties. This is highly recommended, as it allows type-safe configuration of the application, as well as auto-completion and documentation within an IDE.

JHipster has generated a `ApplicationProperties` class in the `config` package, which is already preconfigured, and it is already documented at the bottom the `application.yml`, `application-dev.yml` and `application-prod.yml` files. All you need to do is code your own specific properties.
