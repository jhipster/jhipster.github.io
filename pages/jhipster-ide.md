# <i class="fa fa-object-group"></i> JHipster IDE

JHipster IDE is an Xtext DSL which provides textual editing support of JHipster Domain Language files for popular IDEs and editors such as Eclipse, Visual Studio Code and Atom.

The following features are available:

- Syntax Coloring
- Error Checking
- Auto-Completion
- Formatting
- Hover Information
- Mark Occurences
- Go To Declaration
- Rename Refactoring
- Toggle Comments
- Outline / Structure View
- Quick Fix Proposals
- Find References
- Folding

Furthermore, JHipster IDE generates automatically an UML diagram of the JDL file and provides an integration with the Eclipse terminal shell to call JHipster's Yeoman generator.

Another nice feature is Xdocker (only for Eclipse available) which allows to edit, build and run Docker files and images generated by JHipster directly from the IDE.
