# <i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> JHipster Shell Plugins

Shell plugins bring additional shortcuts for using JHipster, which makes it faster and easier to use. If you've seen people having a beautiful shell, with nice auto-completion and ultra-fast shortcuts, the magic comes from here!

Currently there are two shell plugins:

* [Oh-My-Zsh JHipster plugin]({{ site.url }}/oh-my-zsh/) for [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
* [Fisher JHipster plugin]({{ site.url }}/fisher/) for [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
