## <a name="microservices_vs_monolithic"></a> Microservices vs Monolithic architecture

The first question JHipster will ask you is the kind of application you want to generate. You have the choice between two architecture styles:

- A "monolithic" architecture uses a single, one-size-fits-all application, which contains both the front-end Angular code, and the back-end Spring Boot code.
- A "microservices" architecture splits the front-end and the back-end, so that it's easier for your application to scale and survive infrastructure issues.

A "monolithic" application is much easier to work on, so if you don't have any specific requirements, this is the option we recommend, and our default option.

## <a name="overview"></a> Microservices architecture overview

The JHipster microservices architecture works in the following way:

 * A [gateway]({{ site.url }}/api-gateway/) is a JHipster-generated application (using application type `microservice gateway` when you generate it) that handles Web traffic, and serves an Angular application. There can be several different gateways, if you want to follow the [Backends for Frontends pattern](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/bff-soundcloud), but that's not mandatory.
 * [Traefik]({{ site.url }}/traefik/) is a modern HTTP reverse proxy and load balancer that can work with a gateway.
 * The [JHipster Registry]({{ site.url }}/jhipster-registry/) is a runtime application on which all applications registers and get their configuration from. It also provides runtime monitoring dashboards.
 * [Consul]({{ site.url }}/consul/) is a service discovery service, as well as a key/value store. It can be used as an alternative to the JHipster Registry.
 * [JHipster UAA]({{ site.url }}/using-uaa/) is a JHipster-based User Authentication and Authorization system, which uses the OAuth2 protocol.
 * [Microservices]({{ site.url }}/creating-microservices/) are JHipster-generated applications (using application type `microservice application` when you generate them), that handle REST requests. They are stateless, and several instances of them can be launched in parallel to handle heavy loads.
 * The [JHipster Console](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-console) is a monitoring & alerting console, based on the ELK stack.

In the diagram below, the green components are specific to your application and the blue components provide its underlying infrastructure.
