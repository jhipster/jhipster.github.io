# <i class="fa fa-usd"></i> Sponsors

JHipster uses [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/generator-jhipster) to gather money. This money is used to cover project expenses (like running this website) in a transparent way ([See the OpenCollective documentation](https://opencollective.com/learn-more)), and your donation will help the project live and grow successfully.

## Benefits of being a sponsor

- Visibility on the front page of our website for all sponsors and backers (about 100,000 views/month at the end of 2017)
- Visibility on the Readme file of the main project for all sponsors and backers (about 60,000 views/month at the end of 2017)
- Company logos (or) link to your websites on all [http://www.jhipster.tech](http://www.jhipster.tech) pages for gold sponsors (about 450,000 views/month at the end of 2017)
- "Thank you" tweet from [@java_hipster](https://twitter.com/java_hipster)

More benefits will come in the future!

## What will the project do with the money?

As you can read in [the OpenCollective documentation](https://opencollective.com/learn-more), the way your money will be used will be public and totally transparent.

Your money will first be used to cover direct project costs:

- Website hosting
- Developer tooling

Then, money will be used to:

- Pay for project goodies
- Pay Meetup fees
- Pay expenses for developer gatherings: travel & food expenses for core team meetings

And if we have enough money, we might in the future give "bug bounties" to developers who correct major bugs or add impressive new features.
