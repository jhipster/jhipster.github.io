# Where does the development team work?

We do most of our work on [the project's Github page](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster).

We also have our own mailing list: it is publicly viewable, as everything we do in JHipster is public, but only the board of developers can send e-mails to the list. It is available [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/?hl=en#!forum/jhipster-dev).

# How to join the board of developers?

- Participate regularly in the project (commits, PRs, etc)
- Ask someone from the current board, with some bio and background information, and he will submit a vote on the dev mailing list
- Everybody on the dev mailing list can vote (+1 if they agree, -1 if they don’t)
    - Just one “-1” vote will reject the new member, but the person who votes “-1” will need to explain why
