# <i class="fa fa-css3"></i> Customizing Bootstrap 4

**Please note** that this section refers to Angular 2+ with Bootstrap 4. If you are using AngularJS 1.x with Bootstrap 3, please go to the [Bootstrap 3 documentation]({{ site.url }}/customizing-bootstrap-3/).

## Basic customisation

_Pro tip: don't forget to run `yarn start` to get immediate feedback of your changes!_

The simplest way to customize how your JHipster application looks like is by
overriding CSS styles in `src/main/webapp/content/css/global.css`, or if you selected the Sass option, the `src/main/webapp/scss/global.scss` file.
