# <i class="fa fa-css3"></i> Customizing Bootstrap 4

**Please note** that this section refers to Angular 2+ with Bootstrap 4. If you are using AngularJS 1.x with Bootstrap 3, please go to the [Bootstrap 3 documentation]({{ site.url }}/customizing-bootstrap-3/).

## Basic customisation

_Pro tip: don't forget to run `yarn start` to get immediate feedback of your changes!_

The simplest way to customize how your JHipster application looks like is by
overriding CSS styles in `src/main/webapp/content/css/global.css`, or if you selected the Sass option, the `src/main/webapp/scss/global.scss` file.

If you want to use Bootstrap [partials](http://sass-lang.com/guide) in your own `scss` files then import it like below in the beginning of your `scss` file.
For example to use the border-radius mixin:

```
@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/variables";
@import "node_modules/bootstrap/scss/mixins/border-radius";
```

Make sure you import only partials and not main Sass files, otherwise you will end up generating duplicate CSS which might cause issues.

To change the default Bootstrap settings like colors, border-radius, etc, add or change the value of the property in the partial file `src/main/webapp/content/scss/_bootstrap-variable.scss`

All values defined in Bootstrap [_variables.scss](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/blob/v4-dev/scss/_variables.scss) can be overwritten here.

Please refer to the official [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/options/) documentation for more details on customizations.
