<h1><i class="fa fa-group"></i> Profiles</h1>

<p>
JHipster comes with two Spring "profiles":
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"dev" for development: it focuses on ease of development and productivity</li>
  <li>"prod" for production: it focuses on performance and scalability</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Those profiles come in two different configurations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Maven/Gradle profiles are used at build time. For example <code>mvn -Pprod packageor</code> or <code>gradlew bootRepackage -Pprod</code> will package a production application.</li>
  <li>The Spring profiles work at run time. Some Spring beans will behave differently, depending on the profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spring profiles are set by Maven/Gradle, so we have a consistency between the two methods:you will have a "prod" profile on Maven/Gradle and Spring at the same time.
</p>

<h2>
In default mode, JHipster will use the "dev" profile
</h2>
<p>
    If you run the application without Maven/Gradle, launch the "Application" class (you can probably run it easily from your IDE by right-clicking on it).
<p>
<p>
    If you run the application with Maven, run <code>mvn</code>
</p>
<p>
    If you run the application with Gradle, run <code>gradlew</code>
</p>

<h2>
In production, JHipster has to run with the "prod" profile
</h2>
<p>
    Use Maven to build the application with the "prod" profile: <code>mvn -Pprod</code>
</p>
<p>
    Use Gradle to build the application with the "prod" profile: <code>gradlew -Pprod</code>
</p>
<p>
    When you run the application, don't forget to add the "prod" profile, by adding <code>--spring.profiles.active=prod</code> to your program arguments.
</p>
<p>
    You can test it with Maven, by running <code>mvn -Pprod</code>
</p>
<p>
    You can test it with Gradle, by running <code>gradlew -Pprod</code>
</p>
