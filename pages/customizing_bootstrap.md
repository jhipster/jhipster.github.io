# <i class="fa fa-css3"></i> Customizing Bootstrap

_Pro tip: don't forget use to `grunt` or `gulp` to get immediate feedback of your changes!_

## Basic customisation

The simplest way to customize how your JHipster application looks like is by
overriding CSS styles in `src/main/webapp/assets/{{ site.url }}/images/styles/main.css` if you don't use
Sass or in `src/main/scss/main.scss` if you do.

With Sass you can go further by combining Bootstrap-sass mixins to create your own classes.

If you have selected Sass when generating your application, JHipster has already imported bootstrap-sass main file into your `src/main/scss/main.scss` and has installed them in `src/main/webapp/bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets`.

main.scss

	// bower:scss
	@import "bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss";
	// endbower

This import statement has been inserted by the wiredep task because it is enclosed by bower comments, it
imports `src/main/webapp/bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_bootstrap.scss`.

## Advanced customisation

If you want to go further into Bootstrap customisation by excluding some components, adding new ones or replacing standard ones with yours, you must exclude the standard Bootstrap SASS files from the
wiredep task in 'Gruntfile.js' or `gulpfile.js` so that your custom one is picked up instead:

Gruntfile.js

    wiredep: {
        app: {
            src: ['src/main/webapp/index.html', 'src/main/scss/main.scss'],
            exclude: [/angular-i18n/, /swagger-ui/, /bootstrap-sass\/assets\/stylesheets/],

gulpfile.js

	gulp.task('wiredep:app', function () {
	    ...
	    gulp.src('src/main/scss/main.scss')
	    .pipe(wiredep({
	        exclude: [/angular-i18n/, /swagger-ui/, /bootstrap-sass\/assets\/stylesheets/]],
	    ...


Copy `src/main/webapp/bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/_bootstrap.scss` to `src/main/scss/_custom-bootstrap.scss`

Edit your `_custom-bootstrap.scss` file to add "bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/" to all import statements so that they point to the `bower_components` directory.

	// Core variables and mixins
	@import "bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/variables";
	@import "bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins";

Import it into your `main.scss` file outside the bower comments:

	@import "custom-bootstrap";

	// bower:scss
	// endbower


Pay attention to the fact that the `@import` statements do not specify the leading underscore nor the `.scss` filename extension, this is what SASS calls partials.

Test that your project still builds your stylesheets by running `grunt build` or `gulp build`.

It's very likely that you will want to replace some values in the bootstrap variables, just copy `src/main/webapp/bower_components/bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/_variables.scss` to `src/main/scss/_custom-variables.scss` and change the variables values you want and change related import statement in `_custom-bootstrap.scss`:

	// Core variables and mixins
	@import "custom-variables";
	@import "bootstrap-sass/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap/mixins";

You can follow same procedure and naming convention ('_custom-*.css`) for any other partial you want to customise, this will make easier to integrate bootstrap-sass updates.

You can also comment out some `@import` lines in  `_custom-boostrap.scss` to exclude some components you don't need, it's safer to comment out rather than deleting also to make easier to integrate bootstrap-sass updates.

Each time you make a change, test it with `grunt build` or `gulp build` or better use `grunt` or `gulp` to get immediate feedback.
