# <i class="fa fa-meetup "></i> JHipster meetups

We are currently creating JHipster meetups all around the world!

- If you want to create your own meetup, it's very easy! Just do a Pull Request on [this Web page](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/blob/master/pages/meetups.md) to add your meetup directly.
- There is no rule for meetups: you can schedule them when you want, host it where you want, and invite who you want.
- The JHipster team will do its best to support you: we'll RT you on Twitter, put your event on our main page, etc.
