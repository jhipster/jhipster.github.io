# <i class="fa fa-keyboard-o"></i> Configuring your IDE

JHipster projects can be developed without any IDE, all you need are a text editor and the command line. But of course, if you want to be productive, you will want to use a full-fledged IDE. Here is how you can configure it:

- [Configuring Eclipse with Maven]({{ site.url }}/configuring-ide-eclipse/)
- [Configuring Eclipse with Gradle]({{ site.url }}/configuring-ide-eclipse-gradle/)
- [Configuring Intellij IDEA]({{ site.url }}/configuring-ide-idea/)
