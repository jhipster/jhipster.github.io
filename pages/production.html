<h1><i class="fa fa-play-circle"></i> Using JHipster in production</h1>

<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
If you want to use JHipster with the "production" profile, use the pre-configured "prod" Maven profile:
</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn -Pprod
</code>
</p>
<p>
Or when using Gradle:
</p>
<p>
<code>
gradlew -Pprod
</code>
</p>
<p>
This profile will compile, test and package your Java application with all productions settings. It will also trigger a "grunt build", so your static resources are optimized.
</p>
<p>
If you want more information on the available profiles, please go the section titled "<a href="{{ site.url }}/pages/profiles.html">Development and Production profiles</a>".
</p>


<h2>Generating a WAR file</h2>

<p>To package the application as a "production" WAR, type:
</p>

<p>
    <code>
    mvn -Pprod package
    </code>
</p>

<p>
Or when using Gradle:
</p>
<p>
<code>
gradlew -Pprod bootRepackage
</code>
</p>

<p>
This will generate two files (if your application is called "jhipster"):
</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>target/jhipster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war</code></li>
  <li><code>target/jhipster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war.original</code></li>
</ul>

<p>
The first one is an executable WAR file (see next section to run it). It can also be deployed on an application server,
but as it includes the Tomcat runtime libs, you will probably get some warnings, that's why we recommend you use the second,
".original" file if you want to deploy JHipster on an application server.
</p>

<p>
Once you have deployed you WAR file on your application server:
<p>
<ul>
  <li>It will use by default the "dev" profile</li>
  <li>It can run in "production mode" if you trigger the "prod" profile (there are several ways to trigger a Spring profile, for example you can add <code>-Dspring.profiles.active=prod</code> to your <code>JAVA_OPTS</code> when running your server)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Executing the WAR file without an application server</h2>
<p>
Instead of deploying on an application server, many people find it easier to just have an exectuable WAR file (which includes Tomcat 7, in fact).
</p>
<p>
The first WAR file generated in the previous step is such a WAR, so you can run it in "development mode" by typing:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
    java -jar jhipster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war
    </code>
</p>
<p>
Or in "production" mode:
</p>
<p>
    <code>
    java -jar jhipster-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.war --spring.profiles.active=prod
    </code>
</p>
<h2>Generating an optimized JavaScript application with Grunt</h2>
<p>
This step is automatically triggered when you build your project with the "production" profile. If you want to run it without launching a Maven build, just run:
</p>
<p>
<code>
grunt build
</code>
</p>
<p>
This will process all your static resources (CSS, JavaScript, HTML, JavaScript, images...) in order to generate an optimized client-side application.
</p>
<p>
This application will be generated in your <code>src/main/webapp/dist</code> folder, which by default is not checked in your Git repository (see your <code>.gitignore</code> file if you want to change this behavior).
</p>
<p>
This code will be served when you run the application with the "production" profile.
</p>

<h2>GZipping</h2>
<p>
With the "production" profile, JHipster configures a Servlet filter that applies gzip compression on your resources.
</p>
<p>
By default, this filter will work on most static resources (excluding images, which are already compressed) and on all REST requests.
</p>

<h2>Cache headers</h2>
<p>
With the "production" profile, JHipster configures a Servlet filter that puts specific HTTP cache headers on your static resources (JavaScript, CSS, fonts...) so they are cached by browsers and proxies.
</p>

<h2>Monitoring</h2>
<p>
JHipster comes with full monitoring support from <a href="http://metrics.codahale.com/" target="_blank">Metrics</a>.
</p>
<p>In development, Metrics data will be available through JMX: launch your JConsole and you will be able to access it</p>
<p>
In production, your application will try to send this data to a <a href="http://graphite.wikidot.com/" target="_blank">Graphite</a> server, if you have configured one in your YAML configuration file.
</p>

<h2>Security</h2>
<p>
    JHipster comes with some default users generated for you. In production, you probably want to change their passwords: the easiest way to achieve this is to run the application a first time, and then use the generated "change password" form to modify those passwords.
</p>
<p>
    Here are the provided user accounts:
    <ul>
        <li>"admin" is an admin user, with the "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_ADMIN" authorizations.</li>
        <li>"system" is used for auditing purposes, when an action is done automatically (the action is done by the system, not by a user). You should not be able to login with this user. It has the "ROLE_USER" and "ROLE_ADMIN" authorizations.</li>
        <li>"user" is a standard user, with the "ROLE_USER" authorization.</li>
        <li>"anonymousUser" is for non-authenticated users, so it doesn't have any authorization. This user can be useful for some Spring Security configurations, but we don't use it by default.</li>
    </ul>
</p>
