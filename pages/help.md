# <i class="fa fa-group"></i> Community help

Do you need help? Our awesome community is here!

## #1 rule of community help: everything is public

_Please note that we all do this in the spirit of Open Source._

All discussions are public, so that everyone can participate and help each other. If you need help,
you *should* use the methods listed here.

Those tools will ensure the core team knows what's going on in the project, and that everybody
can benefit from each other's answers.

## If you have a question on how to use JHipster

Go to Stack Overflow with the ["jhipster"](http://stackoverflow.com/tags/jhipster) tag.

## If you have a bug or a feature request

First read our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Then, fill a ticket on our [bug tracker](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/new/choose), we'll be happy to resolve your issue!

## If you want to chat with contributors and other users

Join our chat room on [Gitter.im](https://gitter.im/jhipster/generator-jhipster). Please note that this is a public chat room, and that we expect you to respect other people and write in a correct English language!

## If you want to see what the core team is doing
