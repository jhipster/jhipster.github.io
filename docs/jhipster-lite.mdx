## What is JHipster Lite?

As JHipster, **JHipster Lite âš¡** will help you to start your project, focusing on generating step by step only what you need.

Some details about the solution:
- The generated code uses [Hexagonal Architecture]
- The technical code is separated from your business code
- You will only generate the code you want, no additional unused code
- The best quality as possible: ðŸ’¯% code coverage, 0 code smell, no duplication ðŸ˜Ž
- This generator is a webapp using Java (Spring Boot) and Vue.js
