# Doing microservices with JHipster

## Microservices vs Monolithic architecture

The first question JHipster will ask you is the kind of application you want to generate. You have the choice between two architecture styles:

- A "monolithic" architecture uses a single, one-size-fits-all application, which contains both the front-end code, and the back-end Spring Boot code.
- A "microservices" architecture splits the front-end and the back-end, so that it's easier for your application to scale and survive infrastructure issues.

A "monolithic" application is much easier to work on, so if you don't have any specific requirements, this is the option we recommend, and our default option.


## Microservices architecture overview

The JHipster microservices architecture works in the following way:

* A [gateway](/api-gateway/) is a JHipster-generated application (using the microservice gateway type) designed to handle web traffic and serve an Angular, React, or Vue application. While you can have multiple gateways following the [Backends for Frontends pattern](https://www.thoughtworks.com/insights/blog/bff-soundcloud), it's not required. The gateway is built on the Spring Cloud Gateway library and supports both MVC and WebFlux frameworks.
* [Consul](/consul/) is a service discovery service, as well as a key/value store.
* The [JHipster Registry](/jhipster-registry/) is a runtime application on which all applications registers and get their configuration from. It also provides runtime monitoring dashboards. It can be used as an alternative to Consul. *(deprecated)*
* [Microservices](/creating-microservices/) are JHipster-generated applications (using application type `microservice application` when you generate them), that handle REST requests. They are stateless, and several instances of them can be launched in parallel to handle heavy loads.

This diagram illustrates a microservices architecture utilizing JHipster, incorporating key technologies such as Netflix OSS, Spring Cloud, and Docker. It features a gateway for handling web traffic and user authentication, microservices for backend operations, and comprehensive monitoring and logging with tools like OpenTelemetry, Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana.
