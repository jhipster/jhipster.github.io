JHipster has got a [lot of downloads](https://npmcharts.com/compare/generator-jhipster), and as it's Open Source it's impossible to have a complete list of who uses it. We have made this list from what people tell us, and from resources available on the Internet (conferences, GitHub tickets, StackOverflow questions).

If you want to add a company to the list, please [Fill up this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1-Ut-U2NtOAcT9yEZcETnxsxMAsyS-DkBK9zlXLGW1zs).
