## Syntax

The application declaration is done as follows:

```jdl
application {
  config {
    <application option name> <application option value>
  }
  [entities <application entity list>]
  [<options>]
}
```

- Application configuration keys/values are specified under `config` (which must be inside `application`)
- There can be 0, 1 or any application option as you want (provided they are valid)
- Entities that will be generated inside the application are listed via `entities`, this is the recommended way to
  generate entities in applications.
  - This can be omitted but generating entities inside the app would require doing it:
    - from another JDL file inside the app
    - or with the CLI
- The `entities` keyword is optional: you can omit it, but every entity in the JDL file will be generated inside the
  application
- Applications can have regular options (like `dto` or `service`), more information in the [next](#options-in-applications) section.


## Options in applications

Option declarations (`dto`, `service`, `skipServer`, etc.) are supported in JDL applications, but with some rules.

Say we have this JDL file:

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName app1
  }
  entities A, B, C
  dto * with mapstruct
}

application {
  config {
    baseName app2
  }
  entities C, D
  paginate * with pagination except D 
}

application {
  config {
    baseName app3
  }
  entities * except A, B, C, D, F
  service * with serviceClass
}

entity A
entity B
entity C
entity D
entity E
entity F

paginate * with infinite-scroll
```

In this sample, we can see a few things:

- There are 6 declared entities in the JDL file: `A, B, C, D, E and F`.
- We have 3 applications: `app1, app2 and app3`
  - `app1` uses `A, B and C`
  - `app2` uses `C and D`
  - `app3` uses `E` (`* except A, B, C, D, F`)
- Each of these applications declare options and a **global** option in also declared.
  - `app1` uses `dto` for `A, B and C`
  - `app2` uses `paginate` for `C` (because there's an exception)
  - `app3` uses `service` for `E`
  - The global one also uses `pagination` (for every entity)

Here's how files are generated:

- `app1`
  - `A`: will use `paginate with infinite-scroll` (the global option isn't overridden by a local one) and
    `dto with mapstruct`
  - `B`: will use the same options
  - `C`: will also use the same options
- `app2`:
  - `C`: will use `paginate with pagination` (and not `infinite-scroll`, because the local one takes precedence)
  - `D`: will use `paginate with infinite-scroll` as the previous option doesn't include `D`
- `app3`:
  - `E`: will `paginate with infinite-scroll` and `service E with serviceClass`

This example illustrates the **shadowing** principle. Global options are supported and will be used by every declared
application **unless** options are also declared in applications.

Also note this snippet taken from the previous sample in `app3`:

```jdl
entities * except A, B, C, D, F
service * with serviceClass
```

This basically means that `app3` will only use `E` and that the application's entities will use the `service` option,
that means `E` and not `A to F`.

Finally, there the `F` entity which isn't in any application and this entity will not be generated because of that.

_Note: all regular options are supported at the moment._


## Examples

### Basic example

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp
    applicationType gateway
  }
}
```

### More than one application

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp1
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9001
  }
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp2
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9002
  }
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp3
    applicationType gateway
    serverPort 9000
  }
}
```

### With entities

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp1
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9001
  }
  entities A
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp2
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9002
  }
  entities * except A
}

entity A
entity B
entity C
```

### With options

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp1
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9001
  }
  entities A
  dto A with mapstruct 
}

application {
  config {
    baseName exampleApp2
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 9002
  }
  entities * except A
  paginate C with pagination
}

entity A
entity B
entity C
```


## Complete example breakdowns

Example 1:

```jdl
application {
  config {
    baseName myMonolith
    applicationType monolith
  }
  entities * except C, D
}
application {
  config {
    baseName myGateway
    applicationType gateway
    serverPort 9042
  }
  entities * except A, B
}
application {
  config {
    baseName microserviceA
    applicationType microservice
  }
  entities C
}
application {
  config {
    baseName microserviceB
    applicationType microservice
    serverPort 8082
  }
  entities D
}
entity A
entity B
entity C
entity D
dto * with mapstruct
service * with serviceClass
paginate D with pagination
```

Now, several things will happen when generating these applications and folders:

- Four applications will be created:
  - myMonolith in `./myMonolith`, with the server port `8080`
  - myGateway in `./myGateway`, with the server port `9042`
  - microserviceA in `./microserviceA`, with the server port `8081`
    - Even though we didn't specify a server port, JHipster sets one by default.
    - For microservices, the default one is `8081`
    - For gateways and monoliths, it's `8080`
  - microserviceB in `./microserviceB` with the server port `8082`
- Four entities will be generated
  - `A` and `B` in the monolith
  - `C` and `D` both in the gateway
    - `C` in the first microservice
    - `D` in the second microservice
- The `microservice` option is implicit for `C` and `D`
  - Because they get generated on the two microservices, this option will be set by default.
- Options work the same way as before

Note that the generator sets default values if they aren't present (like the `databaseType`).
JHipster Core does the exact same things for you.

Example 2: with options

See the [option section](#options-in-applications).


## Microservice workflow

Dealing with microservices is a almost tricky, but the JDL gives you some options to handle your entities as you see fit.
With the `microservice <ENTITIES> with <MICROSERVICE_APP_NAME>` you can specify which entity gets generated in which microservice.

Take this setup for instance:

```
entity A
entity B
entity C
microservice A with firstMS
microservice B with secondMS
```

Given two JHipster applications ('firstMS' and 'secondMS'), here's what you're going to get if you import the JDL file
in the two applications:

- In 'firstMS', entities `A` and `C` will be generated.
- In 'secondMS', entities `B` and `C` will be generated.

`C` gets generated in both because if there's no microservice option specifying where this entity gets generated, it
will be generated everywhere.

If you decide to import this JDL in a monolith app, every entity will be generated (monoliths don't have restriction
options in the JDL).

_Note: if you want to make the same entity be generated in two different microservices, you can write two JDL files
instead of updating the JDL file. Everytime._

The previous example couldn't have been written like this:

```
entity A
entity B
entity C
microservice * except B with firstMS
microservice * except A with secondMS
```

Here's the result:

- In 'firstMS', only the entity `C` will be generated
- In 'secondMS', entities `B` and `C` will be generated.

It's because, at parsing-time, if an option overlaps with another, the latter takes precedence.
You can also create an entire microservice stack using JDL, [see this blog post](https://medium.com/@deepu105/create-full-microservice-stack-using-jhipster-domain-language-under-30-minutes-ecc6e7fc3f77) for example
