In JHipster, you can specify options for your entities such as pagination or DTO.
You can do the same with the JDL, either with annotations on the entity, or with the following syntax:

```jdl
entity A {
  name String required
}
entity B
entity C

dto A, B with mapstruct

paginate A with infinite-scroll
paginate B with pagination
paginate C with pager  // pager is only available in AngularJS

service A with serviceClass
service C with serviceImpl
```

The complete list of available options is [here](#available-options).


## How to

There are two kinds of options:

- unary (without option value)
- binary (with value)

There are three ways to apply options to entities:

- using the option name (`dto`, `readOnly`, etc.), see examples
- using annotations
- use the `use XYZ` form

Mixing them is not recommended as it reduces readability.


## Syntax

For the regular form:
```
<option name> <option entity list>

or

<option name> <option entity list> with <option value>

or

<option name> <option entity list> with <option value> except <option excluded entity list>

or 

<option name> <option entity list> except <option excluded entity list>
```

- For unary options:
  - the option name and the list is needed
  - the excluded entities are optional with the `except` keyword (see below for more details)
- For binary options:
  - the entity list precedes the `with` keyword and the option value
  - again, the excluded entities are in the end with the `except` keyword

For annotations:
```
@<option name>
entity <entity name>

or

@<option name>(<option value>)
```

- Similar to Java, annotations may take values in parentheses
  - depending on the option, values may or may not be optional


## The use XYZ options

With the use-option form, you can specify some options on your entities.
It was created during JHipster Code 2020, and the reasons behind its creation are to:

- Solve the option-disabling issue (there are more than one way to say 'no' in JHipster: `no, false, none`)
- Propose a way to group options by entities

```jdl
entity A
entity B
entity C

use serviceClass for * except C
use mapstruct, serviceImpl, infinite-scroll for A, B
use pagination for C
```

|Use option value |Comment                                                                                                          |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|mapstruct        |Whether to create DTOs for your entities, if an entity has a DTO but no service, then 'serviceClass will be used'|
|serviceClass     |                                                                                                                 |
|serviceImpl      |                                                                                                                 |
|pagination       |Pagination as an option is forbidden when the application uses Cassandra                                         |
|infinite-scroll  |Pagination as an option is forbidden when the application uses Cassandra                                         |
|elasticsearch    |Requires the application to have the searchEngine option enabled                                                 |
|couchbase        |Requires the application to have the searchEngine option enabled                                                 |


## Examples

Each example will have three forms:

- the regular one
- the annotation-based one
- the use form (when applicable)

### Basic unary example

Regular:
```jdl
entity A

readOnly A
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
@readOnly
entity A
```

### Basic binary example

Regular:
```jdl
entity A

dto A with mapstruct
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
@dto(mapstruct)
entity A
```

With the `use` keyword:
```jdl
entity A

use mapstruct, serviceImpl, pagination for A
```

### all, * example

`all` and `*` are aliases.

Regular:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

dto all with mapstruct
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
@dto(mapstruct)
entity A

@dto(mapstruct)
entity B
```

With the `use` keyword:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

use mapstruct, serviceImpl, pagination for *
```

### all, * example with exclusions (unary)

Regular:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

skipClient * except A
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
entity A

@skipClient
entity B
```

With the `use` keyword:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

use mapstruct, serviceImpl, pagination for * except A
```

### all, * example with exclusions (binary)

Regular:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

dto all with mapstruct except A
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
entity A

@dto(mapstruct)
entity B
```

With the `use` keyword:
```jdl
entity A
entity B

use mapstruct, serviceImpl, pagination for all except A
```

### Option with custom values

```jdl
entity A
entity B

microservice all with mySuperMS
```

### Mixed example

Regular:
```jdl
entity A
entity B
entity C

readOnly B, C
dto * with mapstruct except C
service * with serviceClass except C
search A with elasticsearch
```

Annotation-based:
```jdl
@dto(mapstruct)
@search(elastisearch)
@service(serviceClass)
entity A

@readOnly
@dto(mapstruct)
@service(serviceClass)
entity B

@readOnly
entity C
```


## About services

No services specified will create a resource class which will call the repository interface directly. This is the
default and simplest option, see A.

`service with serviceClass` (see B) will make the resource call the service class which will call the repository interface.
`service with serviceImpl` (see C) will make a service interface which will be used by the resource class.

The interface is implemented by a concrete class which will call the repository interface.

Using no service unless sure is the simplest option and good for CRUD. Use service with a Class if you will have a lot
of business logic which will use multiple repositories making it ideal for a service class. JHipsters are not fan of
unnecessary Interfaces but if you like them go for service with impl.

```
entity A
entity B
entity C

// no service for A
service B with serviceClass
service C with serviceImpl
```


## Microservice-related options

As of JHipster v3, microservices can be created. You can specify some options to generate your entities in the JDL:
the microservice's name and the search engine.

Here is how you can specify your microservice's name (the JHipster app's name):

```
entity A
entity B
entity C
microservice * with mysuperjhipsterapp except C
microservice C with myotherjhipsterapp
search * with elasticsearch except C
```

The first option is used to tell JHipster that you want your microservice to deal with your entities, whereas the second
specifies how and if you want your entities searched.


## Custom annotations

Custom annotations are possible in the JDL, for instance:

```jdl
@customAnnotation(customValue)
entity A
```

The main use case for this is for blueprints: sometimes, you need have custom options for entities, or even fields.
For regular options (`dto`, `pagination`, etc.), these options will be generated in the JSON like in the CLI.
However, for custom options, they will be generated under and `options` key in the dumped JSON.

Here are the field options supported in the JDL:

|JDL option name (field)|Default value|Possible values                                                                     |Comment                                                                                                                                                                        |
|-----------------------|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|defaultValue           |undefined    |any value fitting to the datatype of the field, e.g. "myDefaultValue" or 42 or true |Will define a fixed default value on database schema side on the column, as well as adjust the clients passing in the option as default from input forms (only Angular for now)|
|defaultValueComputed   |undefined    |database functions to generate default values for a column, e.g. "NOW(6)"           |This will generate a default value on database level using the given function                                                                                                  |
