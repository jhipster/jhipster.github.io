## Troubleshooting

We tried to keep the syntax as friendly as we can for developers.
You can do these things with it:

- Declare applications with their options and entities,
- Declare entities with their attributes,
- Declare the relationships between them,
- And declare some JHipster specific options.

If you wish to view the JDL's grammar, there is an HTML file available
[here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/master/jdl/parsing/generated/grammar.html).

### The JDL import only finds one entity when matching MS baseName

This is a known issue regarding the parsing system and fixing it is tricky.
A workaround is to use different names for the microservice and the entities inside.

See [JHipster Core issue #308](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-core/issues/308) for more information.


## Issues and bugs

The JDL is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/main/jdl), and follows the same
[contributing guidelines as JHipster]( https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

Please use the ["JDL"](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/labels/theme%3A%20JDL) label for submitting 
issues and Pull Requests concerning the library itself.

- [JDL issue tracker](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22theme%3A+JDL%22)
- [JDL Pull Requests](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pulls?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Apr+label%3A%22theme%3A+JDL%22)

When submitting anything, you must be as precise as possible:

- **One posted issue must only have one problem** (or one demand/question);  
- Pull requests are welcome, but the commits must be 'atomic' to really be understandable.
