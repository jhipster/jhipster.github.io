## Syntax

The entity declaration is done as follows:

```jdl
[<entity javadoc>]
[<entity annotation>*]
entity <entity name> [(<table name>)] {
  [<field javadoc>]
  [<field annotation>*]
  <field name> <field type> [<validation>*]
}
```

- `<entity name>` the name of the entity,
- `<field name>` the name of one field of the entity,
- `<field type>` the JHipster supported type of the field,
- and as an option:
  - `<entity javadoc>` the documentation of the entity,
  - `<entity annotation>` the options for the entity (see [OptionsEntity][] for a complete list of available options),
  - `<table name>` the database table name (if you want to specify something different that the name automatically computed from the entity name),
  - `<field javadoc>` the documentation of the field,
  - `<field annotation>` the options for the field (see [OptionsField][] for a complete list of available options),
  - `<validation>` the validations for the field.


## Examples

### Basic example

```jdl
entity A
```

This is equivalent to:

```jdl
entity A(a) {}
```

The former the simpler form, without specifying a "body" (braces for fields) and a table name.

### With a custom table name

Specifying a custom table name is possible too:

```jdl
 entity A(my_super_entity)
```

### With fields

```jdl
entity A {
  name String required
  age Integer
}
```

### With field validations

```jdl
entity A {
  name String required
  age Integer min(42) max(42)
}
```

### Blob declaration

JHipster gives a great choice as one can choose between an image type or any binary type. JDL lets you do the same.
Create a custom type (see DataType) with the editor, name it according to these conventions:
  - `AnyBlob` or `Blob` to create a field of the "any" binary type;
  - `ImageBlob` to create a field meant to be an image.
  - `TextBlob` to create a field for a CLOB (long text).

And you can create as many DataTypes as you like.

### Regular expressions

This is a certain validation (only available to String types), and its syntax is:

```jdl
entity A {
  name String pattern(/^[A-Z][a-z]+\d$/)
}
```

Let's break it down:

- `pattern` is the keyword to declare a regex validation (with the normal parentheses)
- `/.../` the pattern is declared inside two slashes
- `\` anti-slashes needn't be escaped

### Commenting

Commenting is possible in the JDL for entities and fields, and will generate documentation (Javadoc or JSDoc, depending
on the backend).

```jdl
/**
 * This is a comment
 * about a class
 * @author Someone
 */
entity A {
  /**
   * This comment will also be used!
   * @type...
   */
   name String
   age Integer // this is yet another comment
}
```

These comments will later be added as Javadoc comments by JHipster. The JDL possesses its own kind of comment:
  - // an ignored comment
  - /** not an ignored comment */

Therefore, anything that starts with `//` is considered an internal comment for JDL, and will not be counted as Javadoc.
Please note that the JDL Studio directives that start with `#` will be ignored during parsing.

Another form of comments are the following comments:

```jdl
entity A {
  name String /** My super field */
  count Integer /** My other super field */
}
```

Here A's name will be commented with `My super field`, B with `My other super field`.

Yes, commas are not mandatory but it's wiser to have them so as not to make mistakes in the code.
**If you want to mix commas and following comments, beware!**

```jdl
entity A {
  name String, /** My comment */
  count Integer
}
```
A's name won't have the comment, because the count will.


## Field types and validations

Each field type has its own validation list. Here are the types supported in the JDL:

|JDL type      |Validations                                    |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------|
|String        |required, minlength, maxlength, pattern, unique|
|Integer       |required, min, max, unique                     |
|Long          |required, min, max, unique                     |
|BigDecimal    |required, min, max, unique                     |
|Float         |required, min, max, unique                     |
|Double        |required, min, max, unique                     |
|Enum          |required, unique                               |
|Boolean       |required, unique                               |
|LocalDate     |required, unique                               |
|ZonedDateTime |required, unique                               |
|Instant       |required, unique                               |
|Duration      |required, unique                               |
|UUID          |required, unique                               |
|Blob          |required, minbytes, maxbytes, unique           |
|AnyBlob       |required, minbytes, maxbytes, unique           |
|ImageBlob     |required, minbytes, maxbytes, unique           |
|TextBlob      |required, unique                               |
