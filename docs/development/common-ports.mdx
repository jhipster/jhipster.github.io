JHipster configures many tools and services, and each of them will likely use one or several ports. Here is a documentation to help understand what each port does, and help in case of a port conflict.

Please note that as per the JHipster [Policy 1](/policies), the standard port for each technology is used, unless that causes a problem (that should be explained here).

The ports here are listed in order, but the most common questions are for ports `8080`, `9000` and `9060`.
