JHipster release 0.15.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

JHipster 0.15.0 comes with two important updates:

- A new "registration" page, that was one of our most requested features: [#309](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/309)
- Corrected a database error that was occurring in production mode: [#305](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/305)

And of course several minor bugfixes and improvements, which are listed [here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?milestone=4&page=1&state=closed)

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
