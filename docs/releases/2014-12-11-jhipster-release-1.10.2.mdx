JHipster release 1.10.2
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a maintenance release for our latest v1.10.x version, to use the newly-released Spring Boot 1.2.0.RELEASE instead of 1.2.0.RC2.

This release should be easier to use for people using a corporate Maven repository, as they might not have access to the Spring snapshot librairies.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
