### :scroll: Others

- Several internal improvements and blueprint optimizations

## Closed tickets and merged pull requests

See the [GitHub 8.7.0 release notes](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/releases/tag/v8.7.0) for more details.

As always, **[you can view all closed tickets and merged pull requests](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is:closed+milestone:8.7.0)**.

## How to install

To install JHipster v8.7.0:

    npm install -g generator-jhipster

It is also available using the JHipster Docker image, as it is automatically built from our source code.

- [JHipster Online](https://start.jhipster.tech)
- [JHipster Devbox](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox)

## How to upgrade

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

You can also use the [migrate blueprint](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-migrate) for more advanced upgrade features.

```
npm i -g generator-jhipster-migrate
jhipster-migrate
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

Since JHipster 8.0, this command will update your project and all its entities.

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_, use:

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
