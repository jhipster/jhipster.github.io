JHipster release 1.4.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

The entity sub-generator has been once again improved, and can now generate one-to-many and many-to-one relationships between entities. Please check our [updated documentation](/creating-an-entity/). Of course, we plan to support many-to-many relationships in the future.

[You can check the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.4.0+is%3Aclosed).

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
