Backward Compatibility Issues
------------

- **v6.5.x and beyond** 

    - **MongoDB**: PersistentAuditEvent Documents not found after upgrading ([#11290](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/11290)). 
    
        - `jhipster upgrade` will remove `@Field("event_id")` annotation on `PersistentAuditEvent#id` domain class.
        
        - The goal is identifying Documents properly by    `_id` field instead, using Spring Data `@Id` annotation. But: when querying pre-upgrade stored documents, the query won't look for `event_id`, thus those won't be found.
        
        - Such specific case should not impact regular applications behaviour.
        
        - Domain backwards compatibility can be restored by adding `@Field(value = "event_id", targetType = FieldType.OBJECT_ID)` annotation to `PersistentAuditEvent#id` in combination with `@Id`.


How to upgrade
------------

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
