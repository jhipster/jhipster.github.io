JHipster release 0.8.3
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

We corrected several important issues in our "production" profile, mostly related to our use of Spring Boot. We recommend all users who want to use the production profile to upgrade.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
