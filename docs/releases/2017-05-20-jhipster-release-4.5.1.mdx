JHipster release 4.5.1
==================

What's new
----------

This is a bug-fix release for our recently-released v4.5.0 version, which had a very annoying [bug](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/5797).

Unfortunately, the only way for us to validate that everything is fine is to do a release, so if you have any issue when running `jhipster`, please:

- Check our [Twitter account @jhipster](https://twitter.com/jhipster) and notify us if necessary
- Use our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues) to track the problem

Closed tickets and merged pull requests
------------
As always, __[you can check all closed tickets and merged pull requests here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A4.5.1+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

```
yo jhipster:upgrade
```

Please note that with our new JHipster CLI release, the new command will be:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
