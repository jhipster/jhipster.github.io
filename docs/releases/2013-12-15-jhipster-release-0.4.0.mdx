JHipster release 0.4.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

- Incredible HazelCast support from [Jerome Mirc](https://twitter.com/JeromeMirc) providing:
	- Distributed hibernate 2nd level cache
	- Clustered HTTP sessions
- A new GZip filter (also from [Jerome Mirc](https://twitter.com/JeromeMirc)!)
- Spring 4 is now the standard
- An "entity" sub-generator is now in BETA version. If you want to test it:

```
- Corrected a bug in grunt-time which was hanging the build in "prod" mode
