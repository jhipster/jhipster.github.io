The `9.0.0-beta.3` release is now available! This release includes [65 closed issues and pull requests](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is:closed+milestone:9.0.0-beta.3) since [9.0.0-beta.2](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/releases/tag/v9.0.0-beta.2), with [9](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=is:closed+milestone:9.0.0-beta.2) from the 9.0.0-beta.2 milestone.

:::warning Previous Beta Releases Were Broken

- **9.0.0-beta.1** was deprecated because the CLI failed with `Cannot find package 'yeoman-test'` when installed globally ([#32114](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/32114))
- **9.0.0-beta.2** was deprecated because it caused `Maximum call stack size exceeded` errors when parsing JDL files ([#32116](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/32116))

Please use this `9.0.0-beta.3` release instead.

- [JHipster Online](https://start.jhipster.tech)

## How to upgrade

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

You can also use the [migrate blueprint](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-migrate) for more advanced upgrade features.

```
npm i -g generator-jhipster-migrate
jhipster-migrate
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_, use:

```
jhipster entity Foo --single-entity
```
