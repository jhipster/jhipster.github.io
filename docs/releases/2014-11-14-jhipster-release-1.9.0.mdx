JHipster release 1.9.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

The highlights of this release are:

- We upgraded to the latest Spring Boot 1.1.9
- We now __recommend__ the use of Maven over Gradle, and the use of Grunt over Gulp.js. Both Gradle and Gulp.js were community-driven add-ons, and we find them hard to maintain, while it is clear that very few people are using them. So we are looking for volunteers to maintain those tools (it you like one of them, speak up! Become a maintainer!).
- We have reworked the generator options, so they are in a more logical order
- We now have Java 8 by default, instead of Java 7. As Java 7 will be end-of-life'd in April 2015, we feel it is the right time to switch!

We are currently preparing our 2.0 release, which is why we are cleaning up the generator. This new release is mostly a re-work of our AngularJS front-end to make it more modular, so you can use JHipster on bigger projects. It is inspired by [Angular Fullstack](https://github.com/DaftMonk/generator-angular-fullstack), which looks to us to have the best front-end architecture.

Feel free to have a look at [at our 2.0 branch](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/v2.0) and send us your comments!

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.9.0+is%3Aclosed)__.
