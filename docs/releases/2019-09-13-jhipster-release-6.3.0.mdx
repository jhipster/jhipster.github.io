JHipster release v6.3.0
==================

This release fixes an **important security vulnerability**:

- Please read the [security advisory here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/security/advisories/GHSA-mwp6-j9wf-968c).
- **Are you vulnerable?** if you use JWT, session or UAA authentication, and more importantly if you use our system to send a link to reset passwords, then you are affected. The algorithm used isn't cryptographically secure, which means that an attacker could guess a reset link, and hence take over any account in the system.
- **How to fix the issue** you probably don't need to upgrade JHipster, as this just affects a few generated files, so this can be done manually. The issue is in the generated `RandomUtil` class. [Here is this class in our sample application generated with JHipster v6.2.0](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/blob/v6.2.0/src/main/java/io/github/jhipster/sample/service/util/RandomUtil.java) and [here is the updated version, using JHipster v6.3.0](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-sample-app/blob/v6.3.0/src/main/java/io/github/jhipster/sample/service/util/RandomUtil.java). So all you need to do is copy the new file, which uses `SecureRandom`, and replace the older file.
- **How this issue was handled** This issue was found by [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://github.com/JLLeitschuh), and was fixed in the next couple of hours by [Frederik Hahne](https://github.com/atomfrede). Please note that we gave a [$500 bug bounty to Jonathan](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10401) as well as a [$300 bug bounty to Frederik](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10402). For obvious security reasons, only the [JHipster core dev team](https://www.jhipster.tech/team/) knew about this issue during that period. We then waited one day in order to inform everyone, including doing [an advisory on our Twitter account](https://twitter.com/jhipster/status/1172387424715988994) so that our users are not caught up with a surprise emergency release.
- **What will happen next** This is the first time we used the "security advisory" feature from GitHub. We certainly learned a lot, and we will provide in the very near future a clear path to report security advisories to the team.

**What's new in this release**

How to upgrade
------------

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator](/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
