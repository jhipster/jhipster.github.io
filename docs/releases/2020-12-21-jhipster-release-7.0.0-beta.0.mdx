Breaking changes
------------

Related to Blueprints and Modules:
- Remove getAllJhipsterConfig - [#12023](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/12023). Use getJhipsterConfig instead of getAllJhipsterConfig.
- Create jhipsterConfig for synchronised config and move configOptions to generator-base - [#12026](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/12026). generators-base-blueprint's jhipsterConfig field is now a proxy instead of a Storage object look at the PR description for migration.
