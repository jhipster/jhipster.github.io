JHipster release 0.6.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

- Upgrade to Spring Security 3.2, and moved the Spring Security configuration from XML to Java Config thanks to the great work of [Jerome Mirc](https://twitter.com/JeromeMirc)
- The whole Spring Configuration is now XML-less. The last XML configuration file is web.xml (Java EE always loved XML!!).
- We have a new "service" sub-generator, for generating business services. You can find its new and up-to-date documentation [here](/creating-a-service/).

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
