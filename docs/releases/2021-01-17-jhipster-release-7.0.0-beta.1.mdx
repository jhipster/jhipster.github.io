How to install
------------

This is a beta release, so it is not available on our usual "stable" release channel.

To install JHipster v7.0.0-beta.1 using using NPM:

    npm install -g generator-jhipster@beta

It is also available using the JHipster Docker image, as it is automatically built from our source code.

However, as this is a BETA release it will not be available using our other usual channels like:

- [JHipster Online](https://start.jhipster.tech)
- [JHipster Devbox](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-devbox)

You also won’t be able to use the `jhipster upgrade` sub-generator, as it won’t “see” the BETA release, which is distributed through a specific beta channel on NPM.

You can look at [v7 upgrade tips](/tips/tip_v7_upgrade/) page for v7 upgrade hints.
