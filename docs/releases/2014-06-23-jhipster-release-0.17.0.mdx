JHipster release 0.17.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

JHipster 0.17.0 is a bug-fixing release. Nothing fancy this time, but this new version corrects so many issues that everybody should upgrade.

For a full list of what has been corrected, please go to [this page](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?milestone=6&page=1&state=closed).

We are more and more in a "feature freeze" mode, as we are leaning towards our first 1.0 release.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
