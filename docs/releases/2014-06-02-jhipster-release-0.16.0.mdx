JHipster release 0.16.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

JHipster 0.16.0 comes with one new major feature: [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) support! This will generate a Gradle configuration, which should work the same as our usual Maven build. But, of course, it is more flexible, more powerful, and more hype!

In case you were wondering: yes, you can use Gradle OR Maven on the backend, and Grunt OR Gulp.js on the frontend. All 4 combinations should work the same!

And of course we have several bugfixes and improvements, which are listed [here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?milestone=5&page=1&state=closed)

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
