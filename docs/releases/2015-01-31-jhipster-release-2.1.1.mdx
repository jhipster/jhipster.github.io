JHipster release 2.1.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation
----------

Looking for the (old) JHipster v2.x documentation? It's [Here](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/)!

What's new
----------

This is a bugfix release, correcting [a platform-specific bug on Windows](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1058). As hipsters, none of the JHipster developers use Windows, so this couldn't be tested!

Please note that this issue was corrected by [@andidev](https://github.com/andidev) and tested by [@atomfrede](https://github.com/atomfrede), all under 24h! Thank you!

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A2.1.1+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
