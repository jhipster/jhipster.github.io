This guide show how to deploy your JHipster application to AWS using [CloudCaptain](https://cloudcaptain.sh/).

[![CloudCaptain](/images/logo/logo-cloudcaptain.png)](https://cloudcaptain.sh/)

CloudCaptain comes with **first-class support for JHipster** and works by creating minimal immutable machine images for your application, which can then be deployed either on VirtualBox or on AWS.

:::tip

As an alternative to CloudCaptain you can also deploy your JHipster application to AWS using [Elastic Beanstalk](/aws).

:::


## Prerequisites

To be able to deploy, you must first [create a CloudCaptain account](https://console.cloudcaptain.sh) and install the [CloudCaptain Client](https://cloudcaptain.sh/getstarted/download).

You will also need to connect your AWS account in the [CloudCaptain Console](https://console.cloudcaptain.sh).


## Preparing a deployment

When your application is ready, you can prepare it for deployment by typing:

```shell
./mvnw package -Pprod -DskipTests
```

Or when using gradle:

```shell
./gradlew -Pprod bootJar -x test
```


## Deploying to AWS

To deploy your application to AWS type:

```shell
boxfuse run -env=prod
```

CloudCaptain will then analyse your application, fuse a minimal machine image for it and automatically provision, configure and secure all necessary
AWS infrastructure (instances, security groups, Elastic IPs, ELBs, MySQL or PostgreSQL RDS databases, ...)

```

Note that you didn't need to explicitly specify things like ports, healthcheck urls or database types. By default CloudCaptain auto-discovers those
from your JHipster war based on your `application-prod.yml` file and the included jars. 
You can override those auto-discovered settings if you want to, but in most cases you won't need to.


## Deploying updates

To deploy an update to an existing application follow the preparation and deploy steps outlined above. All updates
are performed as zero downtime-blue deployments.
