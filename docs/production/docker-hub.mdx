[![Docker Hub](/images/logo/docker-hub.png)](https://hub.docker.com/u/jhipster/)

JHipster has its own [organization] at Docker Hub and provides different Docker images.

The [jhipster-docker-hub] project provides all docker-compose files to launch these images.
To use the docker-compose commands, you have to:

- clone the project: `git clone https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-docker-hub`
- go inside project: `cd jhipster-docker-hub`

:::warning

Based on your OS, your `DOCKER_HOST` will differ. On Linux, it will be `localhost`.
For Mac/Windows, you will have to obtain the IP using following command: `docker-machine ip default`
