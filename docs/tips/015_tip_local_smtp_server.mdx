:::warning

This tip depends on another project which is not supported directly by JHipster.

:::

The project [djfarrelly/maildev](https://github.com/djfarrelly/MailDev) is a simple way to test your project's generated emails during development with an easy to use web interface.

To start locally the SMTP server with Docker:

```shell
docker container run -d -p 1080:80 -p 25:25 djfarrelly/maildev
```
