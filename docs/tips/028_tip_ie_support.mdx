JHipster supports only evergreen browsers.
However you can still easily support some older browsers like Internet Explorer.

In order to do that you have to:

1. Set target to `es5` in your `tsconfig`
2. Then you have two options:
   - Add the correct polyfills from 'core-js', if you don't know which one you should use, check the Angular CLI project and their polyfills.
   - Or use babel + [Babel preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins) to automatically import the correct core-js polyfills based on a browserslist file.


## Full tip using Babel

First, add those `package.json` dependencies: `@babel/core`, `@babel/preset-env` and `babel-loader`. Example with `npm`:

```shell
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-env babel-loader --save-dev
```

(tested with the following versions for a working IE11 version on a JHipster v6.3.1 generated application:

```json
"@babel/core": "7.6.4",
"@babel/preset-env": "7.6.3",
"babel-loader": "8.0.6",
```
)

Now add the following lines at the top of `src/main/webapp/app/polyfills.ts`:

```ts
import 'core-js/stable';
import 'regenerator-runtime/runtime';
```

In `webpack/webpack.common.js`, after

```js
{
  test: /manifest.webapp$/,
  loader: 'file-loader',
  options: {
    name: 'manifest.webapp'
  }
},
```

add the following lines:

```js
{
  test: /\.js/,
  use: {
    loader: 'babel-loader',
    options: {
      "presets": [
        [
          "@babel/preset-env",
          {
            "targets": {
              "firefox": "60",
              "ie": "11"
            },
            "useBuiltIns": "entry",
            "corejs": 3
          }
        ]
      ]
    }
  },
  exclude: /@babel(?:\/|\\{1,2})runtime|core-js/,
},
```

And finally, change `target` to `es5` in `tsconfig.json` & `tsconfig-aot.json`.
