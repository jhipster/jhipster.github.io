__Tip submitted by [@pascalgrimaud](https://github.com/pascalgrimaud)__

:::warning

Those tips don't work for npm 3+ because it uses symlink.

:::

When using the generator-jhipster, the command `npm install` may take several minutes, depending on your connection speed.

This tip can be used in many cases:

- for demo of JHipster, to improve your experience
- for dev team, to regenerate faster a project with `.yo-rc.json`
- for continuous integration


## Create a new project for node_modules

Create a directory which will contain all `node_modules` libraries, and go into it:

```shell
mkdir jhipster-speedup
cd jhipster-speedup
```

Create the directory `node_modules`:

```shell
mkdir -p node_modules
```

The project structure is :

```
jhipster-speedup
├── node_modules
```

:::warning

Use this next command only if your are a developer on JHipster. It will link to your fork project of generator-jhipster:

:::

```shell
npm link generator-jhipster
```


## Generating projects

Create a directory which will contain your new JHipster project, and go into it:

```shell
mkdir jhipster
cd jhipster
```

Create a link to the directory `node_modules`:

```shell
ln -s <your path>/jhipster-speedup/node_modules
```

Generate a new project, and answer to all questions:

```shell
jhipster
```

The first time, it will take several minutes.

The next times, it will use the existing `node_modules` directory, so npm won't download all libraries.

:::warning

If you use specific libraries and modify your package.json, you should copy the `node_modules`
from jhipster-speedup to your folder project, instead of using a link.
