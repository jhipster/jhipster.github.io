__Tip submitted by [@RawSanj](https://github.com/RawSanj)__

_Goal:_ By the using below mail settings you will have the default JHipster application configured to send emails from Gmail, Outlook or Yahoo.

Start by running JHipster with `jhipster` to create a new application or use an existing JHipster generated application.


## Configure 'from' address

Open `src\main\resources\config\application.yml`, edit `jhipster.mail.from` property:

_application.yml_

```yaml
jhipster:
  [...]
  mail:
    from: username@service_provider #Replace this field with the value that will be used for spring.mail.username
  [...]
```

Skipping this step will likely to result in your email is marked as spam.


## Choose any of below Email Service for your Application

### 1. Email Config - Gmail

Go into `src\main\resources\config\application-dev.yml` and change your application to use the below Gmail configuration:

_application-dev.yml_

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  mail:
    host: smtp.gmail.com
    port: 587
    username: gmailuserid@gmail.com  #Replace this field with your Gmail username.
    password: ************           #Replace this field with your Gmail password/App password.
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
      ssl.trust: smtp.gmail.com
    [...]
```

If you use the above configuration with your Gmail password, you might need to [allow less secure apps](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/6010255?hl=en). 
The configuration is simpler but less secure. Also by allowing less secure apps you won't have the ability to use two factor
authentication with Gmail. 

Therefore we highly recommend you use an app password instead of the Gmail password. Please refer to the following Gmail
configuration document for more information on how to set this up. 

[https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833)

This way you will be able to use two factor authentication as well as keep the "allow less secure apps" option off. You can also 
use OAuth2 with Gmail and the configuration method is highlighted in the following document.

[https://javaee.github.io/javamail/OAuth2](https://javaee.github.io/javamail/OAuth2)     

### 2. Email Config - Outlook.com

Go into `src\main\resources\config\application-dev.yml` and change your application to use the below Outlook configuration:

_application-dev.yml_

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  mail:
    host: smtp-mail.outlook.com
    port: 587
    username: outlookuserid@outlook.com  #Replace this field with your Outlook username.
    password: ************               #Replace this field with your Outlook password.
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
      ssl.trust: smtp-mail.outlook.com
    [...]
```

:::note

If you want to send Email from a Corporate Outlook account then set `host` as the Microsoft Exchange Server of your company, for e.g. `emea.mycompany.com`. Also set `username` as Standard Id of the system provided by the company (Domain/Username) and `password` as your system password.
For Corporate Outlook, `username` property in **spring.mail** must match the `from` property in **jhipster.mail**.

:::

:::tip

To find your `Microsoft Exchange Server` : Open Outlook > Click Tools > Click Account Settings... > Double Click on Microsoft Exchange (under Email tab) and copy the Microsoft Exchange Server address.

### 3. Email Config - Yahoo

Go into `src\main\resources\config\application-dev.yml` and change your application to use the below Yahoo configuration:

_application-dev.yml_

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  mail:
    host: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
    port: 587
    username: yahoouserid@yahoo.com  #Replace this field with your Yahoo username.
    password: ************           #Replace this field with your Yahoo password.
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
      ssl.trust: smtp.mail.yahoo.com
    [...]

jhipster:       
  mail:
    from: yahoouserid@gmail.com  #Replace this field with your Gmail username.
    [...]
```

:::note

For Yahoo Mail, `username` property in **spring.mail** must match the `from` property in **jhipster.mail**.

### 4. Email Config - Zoho

Go into `src\main\resources\config\application-dev.yml` and change your application to use the below Zoho configuration:

_application-dev.yml_

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  mail:
    host: smtp.zoho.eu
    port: 587
    username: zohouserid@zoho.com   #Replace this field with your Zoho username.
    password: ************          #Replace this field with your Zoho password.
    protocol: smtp
    tls: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      auth: true
      starttls.enable: true
      ssl.trust: smtp.zoho.eu
    [...]
```

### 5. Email Config - AWS SES

Go into `src\main\resources\config\application-dev.yml` and change your application to use the below AWS SES configuration:

_application-dev.yml_

```yaml
spring:
  profiles:
    active: dev
  mail:
    host: email-smtp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
    port: 465
    username: ********************
    password: ********************************************
    protocol: smtps
    debug: true
    properties.mail.smtp:
      starttls.enable: true
      starttls.required: true
      ssl.enable: true
    properties.mail.smtps:
      auth: true
```

*Similarly you can configure any other email service. Just check the SMTP Mail Server and Server Port of your Email Service and change the above fields accordingly*

___Now run your application! Go to Register Page, submit the form with a valid Email address and you should receive an Activation Email from the above configured Email Address.___

:::note

You can try sending test Emails with your credentials using [these examples](https://github.com/RawSanj/java-mail-clients).
