## Features

[Kafka](http://kafka.apache.org/) is a popular publish-subscribe messaging system. JHipster has an optional support for Kafka, that will:

- Configure [Kafka clients](https://docs.confluent.io/5.3.1/clients/consumer.html#java-client) with JHipster.
- Add the necessary configuration in the `application-*.yml`
- Generate a Docker Compose configuration file, so Kafka is usable by typing 
  ```shell
  docker-compose -f src/main/docker/kafka.yml up -d
  ```


## Prerequisite

Generate a new application and make sure to select `Asynchronous messages using Apache Kafka` when prompted for technologies you would like to use. A Docker Compose configuration file is generated and you can start Kafka with the command:

```shell
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/kafka.yml up -d
```


## Consumer and Producer

A consumer (`<appName>KafkaConsumer` class) is running and can be adapted to your needs.

A producer (`<appName>KafkaProducer` class) is also available and can be called through a REST endpoint (`<appName>KafkaResource class`).


## Running the app

Allow access to the endpoint in `SecurityConfiguration.java`:

```java
.antMatchers("/api/<appName>-kafka/publish").permitAll()
```

If you invoke the endpoint `http://localhost:8080/api/<appName>-kafka/publish?message=...`, you should see the message logged to the console.
