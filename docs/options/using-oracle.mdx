When using JPA, you have the option to use the Oracle database.

_This option is only supported with Oracle 12cR1 and upwards (e.g. 19c, 18c and 12cR2)._

When using Oracle with JHipster, the following limitations will be applicable according to the Oracle database version.

For version 19c, 18c and 12cR2:
- Entity names cannot be more than 124 characters, this is due to Oracle's 128 character limitation for object names, and we reserve 4 characters to generate primary key sequence for the generated tables.
- Entity field names cannot be more than 128 characters.
- When doing relationships, foreign key names cannot be more than 128 characters, so they will be truncated if they are too long.
- When doing many-to-many relationships, the join table name will follow the JPA specification (in the form "firstTable_secondTable"): if it is more than 128 characters long, it will be truncated.

For version 12cR1:
- Entity names cannot be more than 26 characters, this is due to Oracle's 30 character limitation for object names, and we reserve 4 characters to generate primary key sequence for the generated tables.
- Entity field names cannot be more than 30 characters.
- When doing relationships, foreign key names cannot be more than 30 characters, so they will be truncated if they are too long.
- When doing many-to-many relationships, the join table name will follow the JPA specification (in the form "firstTable_secondTable"): if it is more than 30 characters long, it will be truncated.

- Oracle reserved keywords cannot be used as Entity names or Field names.

- Oracle database 19c (EE, SE2, Single Instance and RAC) Docker images can be found here: https://container-registry.oracle.com
- Oracle database 19c Docker build files can be found here: https://github.com/oracle/docker-images/tree/master/OracleDatabase


Note that version 19c is highly recommended because it has Long Term Support (ending in 2027).
