Shell plugins bring additional shortcuts for using JHipster, which makes it faster and easier to use. If you've seen people having a beautiful shell, with nice auto-completion and ultra-fast shortcuts, the magic comes from here!

Currently there are two shell plugins:

- [Oh-My-Zsh JHipster plugin](/oh-my-zsh) for [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)
- [Fisher JHipster plugin](/fisher) for [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher)
