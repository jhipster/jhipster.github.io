If you are using Linux or Mac OS X, [fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) is a great tool to manage your [fish shell](http://fishshell.com/) configuration.

Some of the JHipster development team use fish shell with Fisher, and if you see people using shortcuts in their terminal, the magic comes from here!


## Fisher JHipster plugin

The JHipster Fisher plugin is available on GitHub at [https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-fisher-plugin](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-fisher-plugin).

Currently it only adds shortcuts (full list [here](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-fisher-plugin/blob/main/conf.d/jhipster.aliases.fish)), but we welcome contributions to have better auto-completion!

1. Install it via ``fisher`` command:

    `fisher install jhipster/jhipster-fisher-plugin`

For more details about [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher) have a look at their [usage](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher#usage) section.
