JHipster projects can be developed without any IDE, all you need are a text editor and the command line. 
In order to be productive, people either use full-fledged IDEs or advanced text editors. Here is how you can configure them:

- [Configuring Eclipse with Maven](/configuring-ide-eclipse)
- [Configuring Eclipse with Gradle](/configuring-ide-eclipse-gradle)
- [Configuring Intellij IDEA](/configuring-ide-idea)
- [Configuring Visual Studio Code](/configuring-ide-visual-studio-code)
- [Configuring Netbeans](/configuring-ide-netbeans)
