As of JHipster 5, AngularJS is not supported anymore with JHipster.

We have great support for [Angular](/using-angular) and [React](/using-react), which are both more modern tools, we hope you will enjoy them!

If you still need to use AngularJS 1.x, please have a look at [our archives](/documentation-archive/).
