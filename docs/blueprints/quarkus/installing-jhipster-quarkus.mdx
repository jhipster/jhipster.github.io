Before using JHipster Quarkus, you have to prepare your environment (Java, Node) and install JHipster.

Please refer to the section Local installation with NPM (recommended for normal users) of the documentation https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/.

You can now install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint:

`npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus`

You can validate the installation by checking the presence of the `jhipster-quarkus` command: `which jhipster-quarkus` (for Mac/Linux).

You’re done. You can now start creating Quarkus applications with JHipster.
