## Introduction

JHipster Quarkus entity creations permits to generate

- A database table
- A Liquibase change set
- A JPA Entity
- A Quarkus Panache Active Record or Repository
- A Resteasy Controller, which has the basic CRUD operations
- Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)
- Pagination
- Tests

and delegates to JHipster the client side components generation
