JHipster release 1.7.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

The main new improvement of this release is the [Cloud Foundry sub-generator](http://jhipster.github.io/cloudfoundry.html). It is working so well that we didn't put the BETA tag on it (unlike our Heroku and OpenShift sub-generators). If you [Check the code](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/tree/master/cloudfoundry) you can also see how small and clean it is.

You can now easily deploy your application to any Cloud Foundry instance available, with MySQL, Postgresql or MongoDB!

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.7.0+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
