JHipster release 0.6.2
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a very small bug fix release.

The main change is that you can now access your "grunt server" Web server from outside your localhost, so you can access it while it is running inside a [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) container.

If you want to try out our new [Docker](https://www.docker.io/) container :

- Have a look at our separate [jhipster-docker](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster-docker) project
- If you live in Paris, please join us at the next [Docker Paris](http://www.meetup.com/Docker-Paris/events/156241722/) event, where we will present the solution 

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
