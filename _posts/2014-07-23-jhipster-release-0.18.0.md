JHipster release 0.18.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

First of all, some words on our impressive number of users:

- With 654 Github stars and 43 contributors, we are already the most widely used Spring application generator, far above [Appfuse](https://github.com/appfuse/appfuse) or [Spring Roo](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-roo). Of course, commercial alternatives are left in the dust :-)
- Our [Download statistics](http://www.npm-stats.com/~packages/generator-jhipster) clearly show how well the project is taking off

JHipster 0.18.0 is a bug-fixing release, that corrects [47 issues](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?milestone=7&page=1&state=closed). As we are getting closer and closer to our 1.0 release, we are mostly working on having a stable plateform, and will add new features later.

We also have some new Spanish, Korean and Turkish translations, thanks to everyone contributing to the project!

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
