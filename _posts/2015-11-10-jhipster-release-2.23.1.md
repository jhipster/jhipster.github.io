JHipster release 2.23.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation
----------

Looking for the (old) JHipster v2.x documentation? It's [Here]({{ post.url }}/documentation-archive)!

What's new
----------

This is a bug-fix release, which solves a number of issues from version 2.23.0 and updates a few libraries.

Most important bug fixes
---------

### OAuth2 authentication

OAuth2 authentication was broken when the new Spring Boot 1.3.0 devtools were selected (issue [#2291](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2291)). So we have removed, for the moment, our `CustomUserDetails` class, which was causing the issue: discussion is still under way on how we will solve this in the long term.

### Cloud Foundry deployment

Deployment to Cloud Foundry was broken (issue [#2225](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2225)), as there is an incompatibility between Spring Boot 1.3.0 and Cloud Foundry (see the Cloud Foundry issue [here](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/411)). For the moment we have removed the "executable" flag on our generated WAR files, and have updated the documentation accordingly (you can't run the WAR files directly with `./my_application.war`, you need to do `java -jar my_application.war`instead).

### Wrong HTTP cache headers in production

Our HTTP cache headers where wrong in production (issue [#2239](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2239)). We have corrected then, and have now excellent performance in production back again!

Closed tickets
