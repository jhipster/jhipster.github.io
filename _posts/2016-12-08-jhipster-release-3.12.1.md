JHipster release 3.12.1
==================

What's new
----------

This is a patch release, that corrects a few minor bugs.

The biggest new feature is the support of Microsoft SQL Server, now that it is available as a Docker image. See [#4518](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/4518) for more information.

This release will be used as a base for our upcoming Angular 2 migration: we will merge very soon the Angular 2 code into our master branch, so you can expect an alpha release of JHipster 4 very soon.

Closed tickets and merged pull requests
------------
As always, __[you can check all closed tickets and merged pull requests here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A3.12.1+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

For an automatic upgrade, starting with JHipster v3.4.0, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

```
yo jhipster:upgrade
```

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
yo jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
yo jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
