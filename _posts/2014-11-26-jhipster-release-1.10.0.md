JHipster release 1.10.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This should be our last 1.x release, and we are now going to merge our "v2.0" branch into our "master" branch.

The highlights of this release are:

- We upgraded to the latest Spring Boot 1.2.0.RC2
- We have a new "fast" profile, which is documented [here]({{ site.url }}/profiles/). You can expect to start up a JHipster application in 4 seconds!
- We have corrected lots of small issues, and upgraded most libraries (like Hazelcast or Atmosphere)


And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.10.0+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
