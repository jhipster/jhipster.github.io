JHipster release 2.27.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This version is at the same time a bug-fix release and a first step towards migrating to JHipster 3.0. This is because our main bug-fix is in fact a back-port from JHipster 3.0!

- Recommended JavaScript build tool is now [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/). Gulp will be the only option available with JHipster 3.0, as maintaining 2 tools in parallel is a waste of effort from the dev team. As AngularJS 2.0 is using Gulp, this is also a decision made to prepare our future move towards AngularJS 2.0 and TypeScript (but that will be for JHipster 4.0!).
- Most important bug fixed is [#2932](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/2932) which made the production profile fail when using both Gulp and Gradle.

And in case you missed it, we have released [the JDL Studio]({{ site.url }}/jdl-studio/) to help you generate your entities. Check it out and send us feedback!
