JHipster release 0.7.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

- This is a minor bug correction, that makes the Karma tests passing with the latest AngularJS version (if your "grunt test" failed, it should be corrected)

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
