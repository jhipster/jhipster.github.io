JHipster release 2.4.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation
----------

Looking for the (old) JHipster v2.x documentation? It's [Here]({{ post.url }}/documentation-archive)!

What's new
----------

We have [Apache Cassandra](http://cassandra.apache.org/) support!

Along with our JPA and MongoDB support, JHipster is the only Yeoman generator which provides true [polyglot persistence](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/PolyglotPersistence.html).

If you want more information on our Cassandra support, we have a [specific documentation available]({{ site.url }}/using-cassandra/).

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A2.4.0+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
