JHipster release v5.3.4
==================

This patch release follows v5.3.2 and v5.3.3 which were released today. We found issue [#8351](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/8351) which causes a compilation error for projects using criteria filtering on DTOs. As this is critical for people using this feature, we have released this patch as an emergency release.

For the record, here are the most important bug fixes and enhancements from release 5.3.2:

- Full microservice stack generation using import-jdl [#8335](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8335/)
- Add a TLS profile (back and front) to run the development server in HTTPS [#8138](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8138)
- Angular: Use Mocha+Chai for end to end tests [#8197](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8197)
- Remove non-free and unused dependency to org.json:json [#8206](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/8206)
- Heroku: move Liquibase migrations to release phase [#8229](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8229)
- New languages: Bengali [#8255](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8255) and Myanmar [#8317](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8317)
- Update spring-boot to 2.0.5 and dependencies [#8273](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/8273)

How to upgrade
------------

**Automatic upgrade**

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
