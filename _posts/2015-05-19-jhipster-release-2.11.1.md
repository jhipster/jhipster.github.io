JHipster release 2.11.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a minor release, which validates that our new [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) support is now out of beta!

In the last 4 days, we've had more than 100 applications deployed on Heroku (this is a rough estimate, from the statistics we gather), and had some great feedback which helped iron out a few minor issues.

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A2.11.1+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```

You can also update your entities by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
