This is our first v2.0.0 release! This has been a lot of work, with a lot of contributors, and we want to thank everyone who has participated in this release.

__Why is this called "v2.0.0"?__

We are breaking a few things in this release. Existing users should not be lost, we use 95% of the same technologies, in the same way. But the project has grown up, we have improved our skills, we have had feedback from lots of people, from all over the world. So we decided to rethink some parts of the project, and hence break some of our existing code.

__What are the most important changes in this release?__

- The AngularJS code has been modularized, to make it clearer, and to allow people to use JHipster on bigger projects
- Liquibase is now able to create "diffs" between the JPA code and the database, which allow you to update your database schema much more easily

__How can I upgrade, and know exactly what's new?__

We have summarized all important changes on this document:

[Whatâ€™s new in JHipster v2.0](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16oIpeEyb-qkPjM_bVQ4zX-dlibyH5_21fTrdQllGiwM/edit?usp=sharing)

Everyone has the right to comment the document, so we are going to improve it over time, in a community effort.

__Are there bugs, is it safe to upgrade?__

The code is still very new, and you might encounter issues if you use some of the less commonly-used options. However, we felt it was the right time to release this version as:

- This release is as stable as the v1.x maintenance releases, so it is quickly becoming a better option to use the v2 rather than the v1
- Thanks to NPM we can easily and quickly release new versions, with fixes and upgrades, so we stick with the "release early, release often" Open Source philosophy

__Is this new version more fun than the previous one?__

Oh yes, a lot more!

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster

And then you can update your project when you run again
