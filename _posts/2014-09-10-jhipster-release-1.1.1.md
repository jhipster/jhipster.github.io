JHipster release 1.1.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a bug-fixing release with [a few tickets resolved](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.1.1+is%3Aclosed).

Most importantly, we corrected an error in the Gradle build, and an error when using Token-based authentication. If you have generated your project with the default settings, both of them shouldn't have any impact on your existing application.


How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
