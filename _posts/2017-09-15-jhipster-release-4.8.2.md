How to upgrade
------------

**Automatic upgrade**

WARNING [this has been fixed recently](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/5966), so if you have trouble with this:

- You can still do a "manual upgrade" (see below)
- If you find anything helpful for us, please send us comments on ticket [#5883](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/5883)
- If you have time and want to help, don't hesitate to contribute on this part!

For an automatic upgrade, use the [JHipster upgrade sub-generator]({{ site.url }}/upgrading-an-application/) on an existing application:

Upgrade your version of JHipster:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

And then run the upgrade sub-generator:

```
jhipster upgrade
```

**Manual upgrades**

For a manual upgrade, first upgrade your version of JHipster with:

```
yarn global upgrade generator-jhipster
```

If you have an existing project, it will still use the JHipster version with which it was generated.
To upgrade your project, you must first delete its `node_modules` folder and then run:

```
jhipster
```

You can also update your project and all its entities by running

```
jhipster --with-entities
```

You can also update your entities one-by-one by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
jhipster entity Foo
```
