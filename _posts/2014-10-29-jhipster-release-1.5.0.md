JHipster release 1.5.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

The entity sub-generator has been once again improved, we have now many-to-many and one-to-one relationships working! In that process, we have also cleaned up the entity code, and most importantly the generated unit tests.

Using the entity sub-generator, you can now create complex CRUD applications without coding anything.

Other notable improvements are:

- Upgraded to the latest 1.1.8 version of Spring Boot
- Updated the images to have our new logo created by [@ggaulard](https://twitter.com/ggaulard)
- Support for 2 new langages (traditional Chinese and Swedish), for an impressive total of 13 supported languages!

[You can check the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.5.0+is%3Aclosed).

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
