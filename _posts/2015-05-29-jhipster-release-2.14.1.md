JHipster release 2.14.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

Sorry everyone, release v2.14.0 was pushed by mistake! So this v2.14.1 release is the same as the v2.13.1 release, which was the last working version.

If somebody asks you, v2.14.0 never happened :-)

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```

You can also update your entities by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
