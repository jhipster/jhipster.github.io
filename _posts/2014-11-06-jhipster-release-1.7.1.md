JHipster release 1.7.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This is just a minor release to add support to JodaTime's DateTime, thanks to [#696](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/696).
We found this new feature so cool that we decided to share it immediately!

How to upgrade

Update your version of JHipster with:

```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
