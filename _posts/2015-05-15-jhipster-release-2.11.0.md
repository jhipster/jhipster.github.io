JHipster release 2.11.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation
----------

Looking for the (old) JHipster v2.x documentation? It's [Here]({{ post.url }}/documentation-archive)!

What's new
----------

This new release comes with many small bug fixes, and one big new feature: we now have official [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/home) support, provided by [Joe Kutner](https://twitter.com/codefinger) from Heroku.

Joe also did an [Heroku official sample application](https://github.com/kissaten/jhipster-example) and updated [our documentation]({{ site.url }}/heroku/) accordingly!

We just keep the **beta** tag on this sub-generator for this release, the time for us to have some external feedback, and then we will remove it.

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A2.11.0+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```

You can also update your entities by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
