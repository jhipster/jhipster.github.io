==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation

What's new
----------

This is a minor release to fix [#1419](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1419), which was making hot reloading of CSS files fail.

And as always, __[you can check all the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A2.9.1+is%3Aclosed)__.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```

You can also update your entities by running again the entity sub-generator, for example if your entity is named _Foo_

```
yo jhipster:entity Foo
```
