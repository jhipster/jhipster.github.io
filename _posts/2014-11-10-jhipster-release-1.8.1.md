JHipster release 1.8.1
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a quick release to solve critical issue [#747](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/747), for people using JDK 7 (not just selecting the "JDK 7" option when building, but actually running the generated application with JDK 7).

By the way, JDK 7 will be "end of life'd" in April, 2015, so we will probably drop support for it in a few months.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
