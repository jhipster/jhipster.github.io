JHipster release 2.23.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Spring Boot + AngularJS working together in one handy Yeoman generator.*

Documentation
----------

Looking for the (old) JHipster v2.x documentation? It's [Here]({{ post.url }}/documentation-archive)!

What's new
----------

This is a **huge** release, with 95 closed tickets, and a lot of code changed, be warned!

## We have moved to Spring Boot 1.3.0.RC1

- A lot of code has been removed as it's now included in Spring Boot
- We have followed the [Spring Boot 1.3 migration guide](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Spring-Boot-1.3.0-RC1-Release-Notes), so if you are upgrading from an older JHipster version, it's a good idea to have a look at it, in order to understand what we did
- Spring Boot devtools are now running by default in "dev" mode: you now have hot-reload of your application (without restarting the JVM). This is an incredible improvement, as you will quickly notice!

## We have removed Java 7

This is following last release's deprecation of Java 7.

This allowed us to remove Joda Time and use instead Java 8's new Date and Time API.

## Social login

A long-awaited addition is the possibility to use "social login", such as Google, Facebook or Twitter.

## H2 disk-based support

You can now use H2's disk-persistence mechanism. This is not yet fully working with Windows and with liquibase-hibernate, but this is a good step forward.

## BDD support

Initial support for Behavior-driven development using Cucumber is now available at application generation.

Closed tickets
