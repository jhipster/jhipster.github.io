JHipster release 1.2.0
==================

*JHipster gives you Yeoman + Maven + Spring + AngularJS all working together in one handy generator.*

What's new
----------

This is a bug-fixing release, [you can check the closed tickets here](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues?q=milestone%3A1.2.0+is%3Aclosed).

We have had several issues with Liquibase and Spring Loaded, which should now all be solved. As those issues
were quite important, this is a recommended update for all users.

How to upgrade
------------

Update your version of JHipster with:

```
npm update -g generator-jhipster
```

And then you can update your project when you run again

```
yo jhipster
```
