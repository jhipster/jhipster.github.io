<h1><i class="fa fa-rocket"></i> Creating an application</h1>

<i><b>Please check our <a href="{{ site.url }}/video_tutorial.html">video tutorial</a> on creating a new JHipster application!</b></i>
<h2>Generating an application quickly</h2>
<p>To generate your application, type:</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster
</code>
</p>
<p>And answer the questions asked by the generator to create an application taylored to your needs. Those options are described in the next section.</p>

<p>Once the application is generated, you can launch the Java server within your IDE, by running the Application class at the root of your application's Java package.</p>

<p>As it is a simple "Main" class, it is the easiest and quickest way to run and debug the application.</p>

<p>If you prefer to use Maven, you can also run your application by typing:</p>
<p>
<code>
mvn spring-boot:run
</code>
</p>
<p>The application will be available on <a href="http://localhost:8080" target="_blank">http://localhost:8080</a></p>

<h2>Options available when generating an application</h2>

<h3>What is the base name of your application?</h3>
<p>
  This is the name of your application.
</p>

<h3>What is your default Java package name?</h3>
<p>
  Your Java application will use this as its root package.
</p>

<h3>Do you want to use Java 8?</h3>
<p>
  Depending on your choice, JHipster will either create a Java 7 or a Java 8 application. Java 8 comes with many new features, including lambdas, and having JHipster create some sample code is a great way to start using them.
</p>

<h3>Which *type* of authentication would you like to use?</h3>
<p>
  You can either use a classical session-based authentication mechanism, like we are used to do in Java (this is how most people use <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/index.html" target="_blank">Spring Security</a>), a OAuth 2.0 authentication mechanism (JHipster then provides the necessary OAuth2 server code and database tables), or a token-based approach (similar to OAuth 2.0, but uses a custom token system that does not require database tables). The OAuth 2.0 and the token approaches allow to use a stateless application architecture (they do not rely on the HTTP Session).
</p>

<h3>Which *type* of database would you like to use?</h3>
<p>
  You can choose between a classical SQL database, which you will access with Spring Data JPA, or a NoSQL approach with <a href="http://www.mongodb.org" target="_blank">MongoDB</a>.
</p>

<h3>Which *production* database would you like to use?</h3>
<p>
  This is the database you will use with your "production" profile. To configure it, please modify your <code>src/main/resources/config/application-prod.yml</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Which *development* database would you like to use?</h3>
<p>
  This is the database you will use with your "development" profile. To configure it, please modify your <code>src/main/resources/config/application-dev.yml</code> file.
</p>

<h3>Do you want to use Hibernate 2nd level cache?</h3>
<p>
   <a href="http://hibernate.org/" target="_blank">Hibernate</a> is the JPA provider used by JHipster. For performance reasons, we highly recommend you to use a cache, and to tune it according to your application's needs.<br/>
   If you choose to do so, you can use either <a href="http://ehcache.org/" target="_blank">ehcache</a> (local cache) or <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/" target="_blank">Hazelcast</a> (distributed cache, for use in a clustered environnement)
</p>

<h3>Do you want to use clustered HTTP sessions?</h3>
<p>
  By default, JHipster uses a HTTP session only for storing <a href="http://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/index.html" target="_blank">Spring Security</a>'s authentication and autorisations information. Of course, you can choose to put more data in your HTTP sessions.<br/>Using HTTP sessions will cause issues if you are running in a cluster, especially if you don't use a load balancer with "sticky sessions".<br/>If you want to replicate your sessions inside your cluster, choose this option to have <a href="http://www.hazelcast.com/" target="_blank">Hazelcast</a> configured.
</p>

<h3>Do you want to use WebSockets?</h3>
<p>
  Websockets can be enabled using Spring Websocket. We also provide a complete sample to show you how to use the framework efficiently.
</p>

<h3>Would you like to use Maven or Gradle?</h3>
<p>
  You can build your generated Java application either with <a href="http://maven.apache.org/" target="_blank">Maven</a> or <a href="http://www.gradle.org/" target="_blank">Gradle</a>. Maven is more stable and more mature, and is our recommended choice if you don't know which option to take. Gradle is more flexible, easier to extend, and more hype.
</p>

<h3>Would you like to use Grunt or Gulp.js for building the frontend?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> is the most widely used and most mature build tool for your JavaScript and CSS assets. <a href="http://www.gulpjs.com" target="_blank">Gulp.js</a> is a more recent alternative, which is easier to use and learn.
</p>

<h3>Would you like to use the Compass CSS Authoring Framework?</h3>
<p>
  <a href="http://compass-style.org/" target="_blank">Compass</a> / Sass is a great solution to simplify designing CSS. To be used efficiently, you will need to run a <a href="http://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank">Grunt</a> server, which will be configured automatically.
</p>
