<h1><i class="icon-cloud-upload"></i> [BETA] Deploying to AWS</h1>

<p><b>WARNING!</b> This is a new sub-generator, of <b>BETA</b> quality. Use it at your own risk! Feedback is highly welcome!</p>

<p><b>WARNING!</b> Amazon does not provide a free tier, and does not sponsor JHipster. As such, we cannot test this sub-generator, and cannot garantee that it works correctly. If you want us to be able to test this generator, you can consider sponsoring the project.</p>

<p>This sub-generator allows to deploy automatically your JHipster application to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon AWS cloud</a>.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<ul>
	<li>You can only use it with a MySQL database (PostgreSQL and Oracle will be added later).</li>
	<li>Websockets doesn't work behind the load balancer by default.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Running the sub-generator</h2>

<p>Before running the sub-generator, you need to go the JHipster Generator directory, and install the AWS-SDK with some other dependencies.</p>

<p>Under Windows following these Steps:</p>
<pre>
cd %USERPROFILE%\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\generator-jhipster
npm install aws-sdk progress node-uuid
</pre>

<p>and under Mac/Linux following these Steps:</p>
<pre>
cd /usr/local/lib/node_modules/generator-jhipster # Path to globally installed node modules
npm install aws-sdk progress node-uuid
</pre>

<p>Then log in with your Amazon AWS account and create a user for your JHipster application. To grant this user the required permissions attach the <code>AWSElasticBeanstalkFullAccess</code> policy.</p>

<p>After that create a credentials file at ~/.aws/credentials on Mac/Linux or C:\Users\USERNAME\.aws\credentials on Windows.</p>
<pre>
[default]
aws_access_key_id = your_access_key
aws_secret_access_key = your_secret_key
</pre>

<p>To deploy your application to Amazon AWS, type:</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster:aws
</code>
</p>
<p>This should package your application in "production" mode, create an Bean Stalk application (with a MySQL database), upload your code, and start the application.</p>

<h2>Updating your deployed application</h2>
<p>When your application is already deployed, you can re-deploy it by run the sub-generator again:</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster:aws
</code>
</p>
<p>The subgenerator ask your database credentials again but they will be ignored during the update.</p>
