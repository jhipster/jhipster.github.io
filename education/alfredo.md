JHipster for Education
======================

From an academic point of view, JHipster is a perfect gift from the open source community to complement the theoretical aspects of Software Engineering.

At the Software Engineering level, it's essential to teach the theoretical principles of:

* Object-oriented programming fundamentals: encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.
* Architectural and design patterns of object oriented software systems: Classical patterns and modern ones like Dependency Injection, REST API Design.
* It is also imperative to teach:	 
	 * Design and implementation of data repositories with relational systems
	 * Design and implementation of data repositories with NoSQL systems
	 * Design and implementation of multiple frontends: Web, Android, iOS, etc.
	 * Authentication and Security
	 * Automatic testing frameworks
	 * Version control systems
	 * Build manager systems
	 * Micro-services based Architectures
	 * Messaging systems (EAI)
	 * Continuous Integration
     * Deploy applications on Cloud Platforms

Writing appropriate theoretical materials to teach this huge range of concepts, technologies, methodologies and best practices is certainly viable for the best educational centers. However, providing realistic student exercises with the latest versions of all open source products, that allow the development of web applications, is an almost impossible goal. Orchestrating the integration of all the open source products that support a modern web application: [https://jhipster.github.io/tech-stack/](https://jhipster.github.io/tech-stack/) is only possible, when a vibrant community of passionate developers work unceasingly to achieve excellence at all times.

Traditionally, the practical aspects of Software Development taught in learning centres, used to work with outdated software and was not aligned with the needs of the business world. However, with the emergence of JHipster, it is perfectly feasible to offer a high-quality education on a theoretical and practical realistic level.
