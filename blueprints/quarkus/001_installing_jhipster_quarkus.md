# Installing JHipster Quarkus

Before using JHipster Quarkus, you have to prepare your environment (Java, Node) and install JHipster.

Please refer to the section *Local installation with NPM (recommended for normal users)* of the documentation https://www.jhipster.tech/installation/.

You can now install the JHipster Quarkus blueprint: 

`npm install -g generator-jhipster-quarkus`

You can validate the installation by checking the presence of the `jhipster-quarkus`command: `which jhipster-quarkus` (for Mac/Linux).

You're done. You can now start creating Quarkus applications with JHipster.
