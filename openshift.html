<h1><i class="fa fa-cloud-upload"></i> [BETA] Deploying to Openshift</h1>

<p><b>WARNING!</b> This generator is currently <b>BROKEN</b>!!!</p>
<p>
    Please see issue <a href="https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/1896" target="_blank">#1896</a> for more information, and don't hesitate to help if you can!
</p>

<hr/>

<p>This sub-generator allows to deploy automatically your JHipster application to the <a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank">Openshift cloud</a>.</p>

<h2>Limitations</h2>
<p>
This sub-generator has a few limitations:
<ul>
    <li>You can only use it with a MySQL database, as this is what Openshift provides by default</li>
    <li>You can only use it with the Grunt option (which is the recommended default), as it's the only one providing tasks for deploying</li>
    <li>You can only use it with the Maven option, as it's the only one supported by Openshift</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h2>Running the sub-generator</h2>

<p>
    Before running the sub-generator, you need to install the <a href="https://developers.openshift.com/en/getting-started-client-tools.html" target="_blank">OpenShift Client Tools</a>, and have a OpenShift account created.
</p>

<p>
    To deploy your application to Openshift, type:
</p>
<p>
<code>
yo jhipster:openshift
</code>
</p>
<p>
    This should package your application in "production" mode, create a Openshift application (with a MySQL database), upload your code, and start the application.
</p>

<p><i>If you use the free version of Openshift, please note that the "small" gear is really slow!</i></p>

<h2>Updating your deployed application</h2>
<p>
    When your application is already deployed, you can prepare a new deployment by typing:
</p>
<p>
<code>
grunt deployOpenshift
</code>
</p>
<p>
    Then you can check your application, which is ready for deployment, in your "deploy/openshift" folder. If you are ready to deploy, you can push it to production, by typing (in your "deploy/openshift" folder):
</p>
<p>
<code>
git push
</code>
</p>
