# <i class="fa fa-cube"></i> Creating a module

A JHipster module is a Yeoman generator that is [composed](http://yeoman.io/authoring/composability.html) with a specific JHipster sub-generator to inherit some of the common functionality from JHipster. A JHipster module can also register itself to act as a hook from the JHipster generator.

JHipster modules are listed on the [JHipster marketplace]({{ site.url }}/modules/marketplace/).

This allows to create third-party generators that have access to the JHipster variables and functions, and act like standard JHipster sub-generators.
The hook mechanism invokes third-party generators before and after app generation and entity generation.

## Example

The [JHipster Fortune module](https://github.com/jdubois/generator-jhipster-fortune) generates a "fortune cookie" page in a JHipster-generated application.

It is our sample module that showcases how you can use JHipster's variables and functions in order to create your own generator.

Or, you can use the [JHipster module generator](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-module) to help you to initialize your module.

## Basic rules for a JHipster module

A JHipster module:

- is an NPM package, and is a Yeoman generator.
- follows an extension of the Yeoman rules listed at [http://yeoman.io/generators/](http://yeoman.io/generators/) and can be installed, used and updated using the "yo" command. Instead of being prefixed by "generator-", it is prefixed by "generator-jhipster-", and instead of having just the "yeoman-generator" keyword, it must have 2 keywords, "yeoman-generator" and "jhipster-module".
- A JHipster module registering as a hook should not call `process.exit` in its generators being hooked.

## Composability

A JHipster module uses the new "composability" feature from Yeoman, described at [http://yeoman.io/authoring/composability.html](http://yeoman.io/authoring/composability.html) to have access to JHipster's variables and functions.

For this, it composes with the "jhipster:modules" sub generator:

    compose: function() {
        this.composeWith('jhipster:modules', {
            options: {
                jhipsterVar: jhipsterVar,
                jhipsterFunc: jhipsterFunc
            }
        });
    },

## Hooks

JHipster will call certain hooks before and after some of its tasks, currently available and planned tasks are listed below.

- Post Entity creation hook
- Pre Entity creation hook [planned]
- Post App creation hook [planned]
- Pre App creation hook [planned]

[JHipster module generator](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-module) now has option to generate this.
A JHipster module can register to act as a hook when its main generator is run by the end user. You need to call the `registerModule` method available in `jhipsterFunc` from your main (app) generator to register as hook, you need to pass the below parameters in the method as below

```javascript
jhipsterFunc.registerModule(npmPackageName, hookFor, hookType[, callbackSubGenerator[, description]])
```

- `npmPackageName` npm package name of the generator. e.g: `jhipster-generator-fortune`
- `hookFor` which Jhipster hook from above this should be registered to ( values must be `entity` or `app`)
- `hookType` where to hook this at the generator stage ( values must be `pre` or `post`)
- `callbackSubGenerator` [optional] sub generator to invoke, if this is not given the module's main (app) generator will be called, e.g: `bar` or `foo` generator
- `description` [optional] description of the generator, if this is not given we will generate a default based on the npm name given

## Registering a module to the JHipster marketplace

To have your module available in [the JHipster marketplace]({{ site.url }}/modules/marketplace/), you need to make sure you have the 2 keyword `yeoman-generator` and `jhipster-module` in your published npm `package.json`.
If you find any entry in the marketplace which is not a JHipster module, you can help to blacklist it by adding it to the `blacklistedModules` section of the [modules-config.json file](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io/blob/master/modules/marketplace/data/modules-config.json) by doing a Pull Request to the [jhipster/jhipster.github.io project](https://github.com/jhipster/jhipster.github.io).

Your module will become "verified" if the JHipster team verifies it.

Once you publish your module to NPM, your module will become available in our marketplace.
