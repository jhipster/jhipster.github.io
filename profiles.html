<h1><i class="fa fa-group"></i> Profiles</h1>

<p>
JHipster comes with three Spring "profiles":
</p>

<ul>
  <li>"dev" for development: it focuses on ease of development and productivity</li>
  <li>"prod" for production: it focuses on performance and scalability</li>
  <li>"fast" for advanced users in development: it focuses on fast start-up time, at the cost of disabling some services</li>
 </ul>

<p>
Those profiles come in two different configurations:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Maven profiles are used at build time. For example <code>mvn -Pprod package</code> will package a production application.</li>
  <li>The Spring profiles work at run time. Some Spring beans will behave differently, depending on the profile.</li>
</ul>

<p>
Spring profiles are set by Maven, so we have a consistency between the two methods:you will have a "prod" profile on Maven and Spring at the same time.
</p>

<h2>
In default mode, JHipster will use the "dev" profile
</h2>
<p>
    If you run the application without Maven, launch the "Application" class (you can probably run it easily from your IDE by right-clicking on it).
<p>
<p>
    If you run the application with Maven, run <code>mvn</code>
</p>

<h2>
In production, JHipster has to run with the "prod" profile
</h2>
<p>
    Use Maven to build the application with the "prod" profile: <code>mvn -Pprod</code>
</p>
<p>
    When you run the application, don't forget to add the "prod" profile, by adding <code>--spring.profiles.active=prod</code> to your program arguments.
</p>
<p>
    You can test it with Maven, by running <code>mvn -Pprod</code>
</p>

<h2>
    For advanced users, you can use the "fast" profile
</h2>
<p>
    The fast profile works with the "dev" profile, but makes some changes so that application starts up faster. On a recent MacBook Pro, you can expect to start-up:
    <ul>
        <li>In 6 seconds with the "SQL" option</li>
        <li>In 4 seconds with the "NoSQL" (MongoDB) option</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    To start faster, this profile :
    <ul>
        <li>Uses <a href="http://undertow.io/" target="_blank">Undertow</a> instead of Tomcat</li>
        <li>Disables Liquibase (so you should use this profile with an external database, and not H2, or your database will be empty)</li>
        <li>Disables Swagger (if you have lots of REST endpoints, Swagger will become very slow)</li>
        <li>Disables the Async service</li>
        <li>Disables the Cache service</li>
        <li>Disables the Metrics service</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<p>
    When you run the application, use the "fast" profile with the "dev" profile, by adding <code>--spring.profiles.active=dev,fast</code> to your program arguments.
</p>
<p>
    If you use Maven, run <code>mvn -Pfast</code> (the Maven "fast" profile will automatically select the "dev" and "fast" Spring profiles).
</p>
